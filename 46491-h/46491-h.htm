Specific and Generic Characters of recent <i>Crocodilia</i>. By <span class="smcap">T.
H. Huxley</span>, Esq., F.R.S., F.L.S., Prof. of Nat. History,
Gov. School of Mines.</h2>

<p class="center">[Read Feb. 17th, 1859.]</p>

<p>In the course of a recent investigation into the nature of the singular
extinct reptile, <i>Stagonolepis</i>, I was led to inquire somewhat
minutely into the character of the exoskeleton, or dermal armour,
of the existing <i>Crocodilia</i>. To my surprise, I found that very little
detailed information on the subject was to be obtained from the
standard repertories of Comparative Anatomy, or even from the
special monographs on Crocodilian structure and classification;
but I was still more astonished to discover, among whole genera
of recent <i>Crocodilia</i>, an exoskeleton possessed of characters such as
have been universally supposed to be peculiar to long extinct forms
of the order, and whose existence in any recent species has hitherto,
so far as I can ascertain, been completely overlooked.</p>

<p>The attempt to discover the limits within which this remarkable
exoskeleton is to be found, led me to look, more critically than I
had previously done, into the arrangement and specific characterization
of the recent <i>Crocodilia</i>. I have thereby arrived at results
which, imperfect as they are, may be of service by leading others to
inquire into the exact characters of species not at present within my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
reach; and I therefore propose to preface my account of the peculiarities
of the exoskeleton in two of the genera of recent Crocodiles
with some remarks on the classification of the group, and
with a few notes upon the characters of the species and the limits
of the genera.</p>

<p>Everyone is acquainted with the great improvement effected in
this branch of Herpetology by Cuvier, who divided the Crocodiles,
which he regarded as constituting only a single genus, into the
three subgenera <i>Alligatores</i>, <i>Crocodili</i>, and <i>Longirostres</i>. Subsequent
writers have admitted these highly natural subdivisions;
but there has been a constant tendency to raise their rank. The
genus <i>Crocodilus</i> has become the order <i>Crocodilia</i>; the subgenera
<i>Alligatores</i>, &amp;c., have been elevated into families; Dr. Gray has
shown that the <i>Alligatores</i> must be divided into three genera, and
that there are at least two genera of <i>Crocodili</i>; and, while one of
Cuvier's species of <i>Longirostres</i> has been suppressed, the group
is very generally retained with a changed name (<i>Gavialis</i>), a
very important addition having been made to it in the <i>Crocodilus
Schlegelii</i> of Müller and Schlegel.</p>

<p>Unless the considerable materials contained in the British
Museum, the Hunterian collection, the collection of Dr. Grant,
and the Christchurch Museum at Oxford had been freely placed
at my disposal, I should have been wholly unable to acquire the
information contained in the following pages. It is only right,
therefore, that I should take this opportunity of offering my
thanks to my friends Dr. Gray, Prof. Quekett, Dr. Grant, and
Dr. Rolleston for the many facilities they have liberally afforded
me.</p>

<p>The recent species of the order <i>Crocodilia</i> are divisible into
three families, which correspond with the original subgenera of
Cuvier, and may be termed the <i>Alligatoridæ</i>, the <i>Crocodilidæ</i>, and
the <i>Gavialidæ</i>.</p>

<p>I. In the <span class="smcap">Alligatoridæ</span> the teeth are strong and unequal, and
the posterior ones differ greatly in shape from the anterior. The
anterior pair of mandibular teeth, and the fourth pair (or the so-called
canines) are received into pits in the margins of the premaxilla
and maxilla; while the mandibular teeth behind these pass inside,
and not between, the maxillary teeth. The mandibular symphysis
does not extend back beyond the level of the fifth tooth, and often
not nearly so far. The line of the premaxillo-maxillary suture on
the palate is straight, or convex forwards. The wide posterior
nares look downwards, and are situated forwards on the palate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span></p>

<p>This family embraces three genera, readily distinguishable by
osteological characters&mdash;<i>Alligator</i>, <i>Caiman</i>, and <i>Jacare</i>.</p>

<h3>Genus 1. <span class="smcap">Alligator.</span></h3>

<p>Dental formula, <sup>20-20</sup>/<sub>20-20</sub>. 9th maxillary tooth the largest of its
series. The snout is very broad, flattened, and rounded at the
end. There is an indistinct longitudinal interorbital ridge; and
there are two short ridges along the line of junction of the prefrontal
and lachrymal bones. The aperture of the external nares
is divided into two parts, by the prolongation forwards of the nasal
bones. The supra-temporal fossæ are well-marked and open, though
not large. The vomers do not appear in the palate. The feet
are well webbed. The dorsal bony scutes are not articulated
together; and there are no ventral scutes.</p>

<p>This genus contains only one species, the well-known <i>Alligator
Mississipiensis</i>, or <i>lucius</i>, which is exclusively North American.</p>

<p>Cuvier (Oss. Foss. ed. 4. vol. ix. p. 211) gives the appearance
of the vomer in the palate as a general character of the <i>Alligatores</i>;
but this bone is not visible in the palate of any of those <i>Alligatores</i>
which Cuvier would have referred to his <i>A. lucius</i> or <i>A. palpebrosus</i>,
and which form the genera <i>Alligator</i> and <i>Caiman</i> as here defined.
The vomers are in fact as slender and delicate as in the Crocodile,
and extend only between the level of the tenth maxillary tooth anteriorly
and the descending processes of the prefrontal posteriorly.</p>

<p>What may be called the median nares, or the arch formed by
the postero-lateral part of the vomer and the anterior and superior
lamina of the palatine bone on each side (which would constitute
the posterior boundary of the posterior nares, if the palatine and
pterygoid bones gave off no inferior or palatine processes), are
situated nearly on a level with the twelfth tooth, or with the
palato-maxillary suture.</p>

<h3>Genus 2. <span class="smcap">Caiman.</span></h3>

<p>Dental formula <sup>20-20</sup>/<sub>22-22</sub> (Natterer). The face is without median
or transverse ridges, but it is sharply angulated along a line which
extends from the orbit forwards along the sides of the snout. The
anterior nasal aperture is undivided in the dry skull. The vomers
do not appear in the palate. The supra-temporal fossæ are obliterated,
the circumjacent bones uniting over them. The webs of
the feet are rudimentary. The dorsal scutes are articulated together
by lateral sutures and anterior and posterior facets; and
there is a ventral shield, consisting of similarly articulated scutes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>Natterer<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> has described three species of <i>Caiman</i>&mdash;<i>C. palpebrosus</i>,
<i>C. trigonatus</i>, and <i>C. gibbiceps</i>. The Caimans abound chiefly
in tropical South America; but they are found as far north as
Mexico, a specimen of <i>C. palpebrosus</i> in Dr. Grant's collection
coming from that country.</p>

<h3>Genus 3. <span class="smcap">Jacare.</span></h3>

<p>The snout is broad, and rounded at the end<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>. Each prefrontal
bone is traversed close to its anterior extremity by the ends of a
strong transverse ridge, which then curve round and pass forwards
on the lachrymal and maxillary bones, to subside opposite the
ninth tooth. The anterior nasal aperture is not divided by bone.
The vomers, separated by a longitudinal suture, appear in the
palate between the premaxillaries and the palatine plates of the
maxillaries. The temporal fossæ, though not large, are open. The
webs of the feet are small. The dorsal scutes are articulated
together, as in the preceding genus; and there are similarly-articulated
ventral scutes. There are 18-20 teeth on each side, above
and below; and the fourth tooth in the upper jaw is the largest.
The mandibular symphysis extends back nearly to the fifth tooth.</p>

<p>In a skull of <i>Jacare</i> (<i>fissipes?</i>), 19 inches long, in the British
Museum, I find that part of the vomer which is visible in the
palate to be a rhomboidal plate, somewhat truncated anteriorly, and
rather more than 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch long and 1 inch wide. Its anterior end
comes within <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch of the posterior margin of the anterior
palatal foramen. Its posterior margin reaches to the level
of the eighth tooth. The visible portion of each vomer is only its
anterior end, which forms a thick and solid wedge-shaped plate,
broader in front than behind, and articulating by a rough anterior
and outer face with the premaxilla, by an obliquely ridged posterior
and outer face with the maxilla, and by its internal face
with its fellow. Its upper, rounded surface projects but little
into the nasal passage. 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches behind its anterior end, the
posterior and upper extremity of the vomer passes into a thin and
narrow plate of bone, whose plane is at first inclined at an angle
of 45° to that of the anterior part of the bone, but gradually
becomes vertical; as it does so it deepens, until, 3 inches behind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
the anterior extremity, the vomer is a thin vertical plate of bone,
<sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch deep, which articulates below with the palatine
plate of the maxilla, and, about 1 inch behind this, with the palatine
plate of the palatine bone. The upper edge of this plate nowhere
extends to one-third of the height of the nasal chamber. It gives
off a horizontal process outwards, which, gradually increasing
in width, inclines downwards until it comes into contact, first,
with the inner surface of the maxilla, and, <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>ths of an inch behind
this, with the nasal plate of the palatine bone. In front of its
junction with the maxilla, the horizontal plate of the vomer presents
a long free edge, concave externally; and this bounds the median
nares internally and posteriorly. Throughout its junction with the
maxilla, the horizontal plate is parallel-sided; but after it joins the
palatine bone, it gradually narrows posteriorly, in consequence of
the gradual increase in width of the palatine, and ends almost in
a point, 6<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches behind its anterior end. The posterior edge of
the vertical plate is extremely thin, and <sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch deep. It
articulates with the anterior end of the vertical plate of the pterygoid,
while the straight inferior edge articulates throughout with
the palatine plate of the palatine bone. The vomers terminate
midway between the median nares and the descending process of
the prefrontal. The median nares are bounded entirely by the
vomer and the maxilla. They correspond with the nasal face of
the palato-maxillary suture, but are rather behind its palatine
face, and they are about on a level with the interval between the
tenth and eleventh teeth. If the anterior edge of the palatine
bone bounded them, they would be a little behind the twelfth
tooth. The posterior nares, 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches wide, by <sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch
long, look altogether downwards, are completely divided by a bony
septum, and have the form of a rhomboid with its narrowest side
posterior. They are surrounded by a strong raised ridge, incomplete
only at the anterior and outer angles of the rhomboid.</p>

<p>Five species of <i>Jacare</i> are enumerated by Natterer&mdash;<i>J. fissipes</i>,
<i>J. sclerops</i>, <i>J. nigra</i>, <i>J. punctulata</i>, and <i>J. vallifrons</i>. They have
met with only in South America.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>II. In the family of the <span class="smcap">Crocodilidæ</span> the teeth are usually
strong and very unequal in size, and there is always a considerable
difference between the anterior and the posterior teeth. The two
anterior mandibular teeth are received into pits in the premaxilla;
but the canines pass into grooves (which may be converted
into fossæ) situated at the junction of the premaxilla and maxilla.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
The other mandibular teeth are received between the maxillary
teeth. The symphysis of the lower jaw does not extend beyond
the level of the seventh or the eighth mandibular tooth. The
premaxillo-maxillary suture may be either straight or strongly
convex backwards. The divided vomers do not appear in the
palate. The posterior nares look more or less backwards, and
are transversely elongated. The supra-temporal fossæ are always
open, and the feet are distinctly webbed. The dorsal scutes are
not articulated; and there are no ventral scutes.</p>

<p>Two genera, <i>Crocodilus</i> and <i>Mecistops</i>, are distinguishable in
this family.</p>

<h3>Genus 4. <span class="smcap">Crocodilus.</span></h3>

<p>The teeth are always strong and very unequal, the strongest in
the upper jaw being the tenth. The mandibular symphysis does
not extend beyond the level of the sixth tooth. There are usually
six cervical scutes, in two rows, or forming a rhomb, and separated
by a distinct interval from the tergal scutes. There are 18 or 19
teeth above, and 15 below, on each side.</p>

<h3>1. <i>Crocodilus vulgaris.</i></h3>

<p>As Cuvier has remarked, it is extremely difficult to find good
distinctive characters for all the species of this genus. My first
difficulty was to ascertain the precise characters of that species
which has been misnamed <i>vulgaris</i>, inasmuch as I could find
neither in the British Museum, nor in the Museum of the Royal
College of Surgeons, any <i>authentic</i> skeleton or skull of this, the
so-called Nilotic Crocodile. This difficulty subsisted up to the
time that the chief statements contained in the present essay were
laid before the Linnean Society; but since then I have been enabled,
by Dr. Gray's permission, to examine the skull of a small
stuffed specimen, brought to this country from Egypt by Sir
Gardner Wilkinson, and to study the splendid entire skeleton of a
<i>Crocodilus vulgaris</i> in the Christchurch Museum at Oxford, presented
to that Institution by the gentlemen who shot it on the Nile,
and set up with great care under the auspices of my friend Dr.
Rolleston, Lee's Reader in Anatomy and Curator of the Museum.
Fortunately the entire skin has been preserved; so that this is the
most complete record of the hard parts of any individual crocodile
with which I am acquainted, besides being, so far as I am aware,
the only authentic entire skeleton of <i>Crocodilus vulgaris</i> in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
country. I subjoin the chief points of interest which I noted in
my brief examination of this valuable specimen:&mdash;</p>

<p>From the above measurements it will be seen that the skull is
somewhat slender. Behind the canine groove it widens to the
tenth tooth, which is 5<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches behind the end of the snout. It
retains about the same diameter to the twelfth tooth, and then
slowly widens again,&mdash;a sudden increase in size, to the extent of
half-an-inch, taking place opposite the posterior margin of the
orbit, owing to the flanging-out of the jugal. On the whole,
however, there is a slow and even increase in breadth, from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
canine groove to the ends of the ossa quadrata. The nasal
aperture is pyriform, its wider end being forwards, and its narrow
posterior extremity, into which the pointed ends of the nasal bones
project, attaining the level of the first tooth behind the canine
groove.</p>

<p>On the left side there is only a pit for the reception of the
anterior mandibular tooth, while on the right side this pit is converted
into a complete foramen. On the upper face of the skull,
the premaxillo-maxillary suture runs vertically upwards through
the canine groove, and then passes obliquely backwards to a point
5 inches behind the end of the snout. The anterior part of this
suture lies in a strong ridge, which is continued downwards and
forwards on the premaxilla to the level of the fifth tooth, a groove
separating it from the margin of the nasal aperture. Posteriorly
this ridge dies away, but a curved irregular elevation, convex
inwards, arises opposite the tenth tooth. It is wholly confined to
the maxilla, not extending on to the nasals.</p>

<p>There is a distinct, rough, irregular elevation, bounded on its
outer side by a sharp groove, which extends back to the orbit, on
the lachrymal bone. The profile of the skull is convex as far as the
posterior boundary of the nostril, and very slightly concave from that
point as far as the twelfth tooth. It then passes back as a straight,
slightly ascending line, only interrupted by the lachrymal ridge, to
the margin of the occiput. The inferior margin of the maxilla is
convex downwards as far as the canine groove, whose lower end
is indicated by a deep sinuation. It then becomes convex again,
the crown of the curve being at the ninth and tenth teeth, and its
posterior end sweeping into a concavity whose summit is at the
twelfth tooth. Behind this the edge of the maxilla is only slightly
convex. The inferior contour of the jugal bone is very concave;
but the articular end of the quadrate bone descends to the level
of the edge of the ninth alveolus.</p>

<p>The orbits have a sort of heart-shape, their apices being turned
forwards, and their more convex sides inwards.</p>

<p>The supra-temporal fossæ are half-moon-shaped, their straight
sides being external and so inclined that, if prolonged, they would
decussate upon a line joining the anterior margins of the orbits.</p>

<p>On the palatine surface of the skull, the premaxillo-maxillary
suture runs backwards from the canine groove, as far as the level
of the middle of the second alveolus behind the groove (or that of
the seventh tooth), which point it reaches at about the junction
of the middle with the inner third of the palatine plate of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
maxilla. The suture then turns abruptly forwards until it reaches
the level of the anterior margin of the alveolus of the sixth tooth,
when it bends suddenly inwards to meet its fellow. The whole
suture, therefore, has the form of a W. The vomers are completely
hidden.</p>

<p>The posterior nares look downwards and backwards; their aperture
is, from the incompleteness of the septum, single, and has a
transversely elongated crescentic form. It measures 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch in
width by <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths antero-posteriorly. The basi-sphenoid is seen for
about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>th of an inch on the base of the skull behind it, bounding
the sides of the eustachian tube. The dental formula is <sup>18-18</sup>/<sub>15-15</sub>.
The fourth and tenth teeth are largest in the upper jaw, the first
and fourth in the lower. The eight posterior teeth on each side
in the upper jaw, and the five posterior in the lower, have a
marked constriction between the short crown and the fang of the
tooth. There are deep interdental pits for the reception of the
mandibular teeth between the third and fourth, and fourth and
fifth teeth above, and between the succeeding teeth from the
sixth to the thirteenth.</p>

<p>The hyoidean cornua are very strong curved bones, the chord of
whose arc measures 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches. They are concave inwards, convex
outwards, concave posteriorly, convex anteriorly; they are flattened
from side to side below, but they end above in subcylindrical
styloid extremities.</p>

<p>In the ninth vertebra the neurocentral suture passes just above
the base of the parapophysis; it traverses the parapophysis in the
tenth and eleventh vertebræ, while in the twelfth the parapophysis
suddenly rises to the root of the diapophysis, and the suture lies far
below it. The centra of the dorsal vertebræ, as far as the thirteenth
inclusive, have hypapophyses. The diapophyses of the ninth vertebra
pass almost horizontally outwards, but are a good deal inclined
backwards. In the succeeding vertebræ up to the fourteenth
or fifteenth, the diapophyses are, in addition, inclined upwards, the
upward inclination being most marked in the tenth, eleventh and
twelfth vertebræ. From the fifteenth vertebra onwards, the
transverse processes pass almost directly outwards, without either
upward or backward inclination. The span of the transverse processes
is greatest in the eighteenth and nineteenth vertebræ, in
which the distance between the extremities of these processes is
7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches, a length about equal to that of the longest vertebral rib.</p>

<p>The rib of the ninth vertebra is terminated by a single long and
slender semicartilaginous process which does not unite with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
sternum. Each of the vertebral ribs from the tenth to the seventeenth
vertebræ inclusively, on the other hand, is united with the sternum,
or its continuation, by two such semicartilaginous costal elements,
which may be respectively termed sternal and lateral. The sternal
elements of the ribs of the tenth and eleventh vertebræ are united
with the sternum proper; those of the next five vertebræ are connected
with its median backward prolongation, while those of the
seventeenth vertebra are attached to the processes into which this
prolongation divides posteriorly.</p>

<p>The sternal costal elements are very broad and flat, and though
the lateral ones are less so, they are wide and expanded. The
lateral costal pieces of the eleventh to the sixteenth vertebræ
inclusively, give attachment to very large and flat, triangular, <i>processus
uncinati</i>. Those of the twelfth are 3<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches long and 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>
inch wide at their widest part. The transverse processes of the
twentieth vertebra bear rudimentary ribs. The centrum of the
thirteenth vertebra is 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch long, and the vertebra is 3<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches
high from the lower edge of the centrum to the summit of the
neural spine. The centra of the vertebræ retain nearly the same
length to the twentieth caudal; but behind this vertebra they
are shorter, as are the anterior dorsal vertebræ. The first caudal
vertebra is provided with two styliform bones, which represent the
chevron bones of the other caudal vertebræ, but are not united
below.</p>

<p>The dorsal scutes have the arrangement which his often been
described. They are separated (except perhaps the median rows)
by integumentary spaces, neither overlapping nor uniting by
sutures; and there are no ventral scutes.</p>

<p>Among the osteological characters which have been detailed, the
peculiarities of the tergal armour, the proportions of the skull,
combined with the characters of the ridges upon its surface, and
the form of the premaxillo-maxillary suture amply suffice to diagnose
this species. Even in the small skull, only 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches long,
lent to me by Dr. Gray, the characteristic features of the species
are well exhibited, although age appears to give rise to many differences.
Thus the posterior margin of the external nostrils does
not extend so far back as in the adult, and the facial is smaller in
proportion to the syncipital region, whose anterior and posterior
transverse dimensions are very nearly equal. The orbits are proportionally
larger, the interorbital space more excavated; and the
outer straight margins of the supra-temporal fossæ are parallel with
the longitudinal axis of the skull. Still more important differences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
are visible on the palatine face of the skull. The premaxillo-maxillary
suture reaches back, indeed, to the line of the seventh
tooth; but it forms an even curve whose summit is in the middle
line. The aperture of the posterior nares, again, has a totally different
form from that which it assumes in the adult. It is somewhat
heart-shaped, with its apex forwards, measures <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch long
by <sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths at broadest, and looks altogether downwards, while its
anterior margin is situated far more forward in the palate than
that of the adult.</p>

<h3>2. <i>Crocodilus biporcatus.</i></h3>

<p>This, the best-known Crocodile, is a very well-marked species,
characterized (beside the peculiarities of its dermal armour) by a
comparatively slender skull, similar in shape to that of <i>C. vulgaris</i>,
and, like it, without any sudden enlargement immediately
behind the canine groove; and by the strong ridge which arises
on each lachrymal bone close to the anterior edge of the orbit,
and is continued forwards on to the line of junction of the nasal
and maxillary bones, so that the naso-maxillary suture traverses
the axis of the ridge, and then <span class="smcap">curves</span> outwards, descending
towards the alveolus of the tenth tooth. The premaxillo-maxillary
suture is W-shaped; and its salient angles reach backwards
even to the level of the posterior margin of the seventh alveolus.</p>

<h3>3. <i>Crocodilus Americanus</i> (<i>acutus</i>, Cuv.)</h3>

<p>has the slenderness of snout (even more marked) and the form of
the premaxillo-maxillary suture of the preceding species; but it is
at once distinguished from this and all other Crocodiles (except
<i>C. rhombifer</i>) by the marked longitudinal and transverse convexity
of the middle of the face, which gives the profile a totally different
aspect from that of the other species, which are flat or concave in
this region.</p>

<h3>4. <i>Crocodilus Journei</i></h3>

<p>is another unmistakeably distinct and very remarkable species.
The descriptions and figures given by Graves, Bory de St. Vincent,
and Duméril and Bibron, of the unique specimen of this Crocodile
to the Bordeaux Museum, would alone have compelled me to differ
entirely from the view taken by Dr. Gray of the affinities of this
species. These observers agree in stating that <i>Crocodilus Journei</i>
has six cervical scutes, arranged as in the other Crocodiles, and, as
Graves says, "separated by an interval of four inches" from the
commencement of the tergal scutes, whence it is obviously impossible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
that it can be a <i>Mecistops</i>. But, in addition to this, I had
the good fortune to find, among the recent additions to that excellent
osteological collection which Dr. Gray has gradually formed
at the British Museum, the skull of a Crocodile obtained from a
dealer in Paris, and labelled by him "Croc. de l'Orinoke." I at
first imagined this Crocodile to be a <i>Mecistops</i>; but on careful investigation
it turned out to be no other than the skull of a <i>Crocodilus
Journei</i>, somewhat larger than the Bordeaux specimen, but,
as the subjoined measurements will prove, agreeing with it in all
its proportions:&mdash;</p>

<p>Now Duméril and Bibron expressly state that the length of the
head of <i>C. Journei</i> equals 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> times its greatest transverse diameter,
that the width of the jaws at the anterior margins of the orbit
equals one-fourth the length of the head, and that at the tenth
tooth it equals one-sixth the length of the head; and these are as
nearly as possible, it will be observed, the relations of the same
dimensions in the above list.</p>

<p>In the specimen in the British Museum there are eighteen teeth
on each side above, and fifteen below. The Bordeaux specimen is
stated to have the same dental formula, except that there are sixteen
teeth in the left ramus of the mandible. The fourth and tenth
maxillary teeth are stated by Graves to be as large again as the
others; and the corresponding alveoli have these proportions to
one another in the British Museum specimen. In fact, there can
be no doubt that this skull is that of a true <i>Crocodilus Journei</i>.</p>

<p>But its general characters at once prove the close affinity of <i>C.
Journei</i> with the other true Crocodiles, from which it differs only
in its elongated and gradually tapering skull, and in the more
backward extension of the mandibular symphysis<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>, which attains
the level of the posterior margin of the sixth tooth.</p>

<p>In this character, and in the extreme slenderness of the snout,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
there is doubtless an approximation to <i>Mecistops</i>; but <i>Crocodilus
Journei</i> is sharply separated from that genus by the characters
of its teeth, and by those of its dermal armour.</p>

<h3>5. <i>Crocodilus bombifrons</i> (<i>palustris?</i>).</h3>

<p>All the species of <i>Crocodilus</i> which I have hitherto mentioned
have, in common, the backward curvature of the premaxillo-maxillary
suture to the level of the seventh tooth. But there is a species of
Crocodile, about whose proper specific name I am by no means
clear, in which this suture passes straight across the palate, or may
even be a little convex forwards.</p>

<p>And not only do the skulls of this species exhibit this approximation
to those of the <i>Alligatoridæ</i>, but they resemble them still
further in their rounded snouts, their great width immediately
behind the canine groove, and in the fact that, in young specimens,
one or the other canine may be received into a pit instead
of into a groove<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>.</p>

<p>In the Hunterian Collection there are seven skulls, varying in
length from 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches up to 16 inches, in none of which does the
crown of the premaxillo-maxillary suture extend beyond a line
joining the sixth pair of teeth. In all there are two short ridges
(convergent in young specimens, nearly parallel in old ones) upon
the lachrymal bones, which end before reaching the anterior limits
of those bones. They all have an oblique ridge on the upper jaw
above the tenth tooth; and the snout attains the width which it
has opposite this tooth immediately behind the canine groove.
In the British Museum there are five middle-sized skulls with the
same characters; but two of these have a pit on one side of the
upper jaw, and a groove on the other, and one has something
between a pit and a groove on each side.</p>

<p>Dr. Gray, has in his 'Catalogue<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>,' mentioned the peculiar transverse
disposition of the premaxillo-maxillary suture in his <i>Crocodilus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
bombifrons</i>; and on examining the two crania thus named in
the British Museum collection, one of which is 20 and the other
21 inches long, I can discover no distinguishing character between
them and those already described. There can be no doubt
then, I think, that these constant and well-marked characters,
exhibited by fourteen skulls which vary in length from 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> to
21 inches, prove the existence of a distinct species of Crocodile,
which I would provisionally term <i>bombifrons</i>.</p>

<p>I believe that this species has been constantly confounded
with <i>biporcatus</i>, from which it may be at once distinguished by
the direction of the premaxillo-maxillary suture, and by the shape
of the snout behind the canine groove. I have found these distinctions
to hold good at all ages; but the last-mentioned difference
is far more marked in middle-aged than in either young or
old specimens.</p>

<p>All the skulls named <i>Crocodilus palustris</i> which I have seen are
referable either to <i>C. biporcatus</i> or to <i>C. bombifrons</i>. With respect
to the <i>C. palustris</i> of Lesson and Duméril and Bibron, the latter
authors consider it to be only a variety of <i>C. vulgaris</i>. Their description
would, however, apply very well to <i>C. bombifrons</i>, as I have defined
it above; and they expressly state ('Erp. Générale,' t. iii.
p. 113) that all their specimens (twelve in number and varying in
length from 30 centimetres to more than 3 metres) came from the
East Indies or the Seychelle Islands. Now, Duméril and Bibron
enumerate only three Asiatic Crocodiles&mdash;<i>C. biporcatus</i>, <i>C. palustris</i>,
and <i>C. galeatus</i>, the last of which was only known to them
by description; so that all the numerous Asiatic crocodiles which
passed through their hands belonged either to <i>C. biporcatus</i> or <i>C.
palustris</i>. On the other hand, all the skulls of crocodiles from Asia
which I have met with (amounting to at least twenty) are either
those of <i>C. biporcatus</i> or of the species which I have called <i>bombifrons</i>;
so that I suspect the latter title will turn out to be a
synonym of <i>palustris</i>.</p>

<h3>6. <i>Crocodilus rhombifer.</i></h3>

<p>I have not been able to obtain any skull of this species, which,
according to Cuvier's account and figures ('Oss. Fossiles,' t. ix.
p. 102), resembles <i>C. Americanus</i> in the great convexity of its
nasal region, but differs from it in the greater breadth of the skull,
and in the strong converging preorbital ridges, which appear to be
limited to the lachrymal bones. If the figures are to be I trusted,
however, there are other very important distinctive characters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
about the cranium of this species; for Cuvier's, fig. 2, pl. 331, which
gives a view of the palate, shows the premaxillo-maxillary suture
forming a nearly straight transverse line.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There remain several species of <i>Crocodilus</i> whose skulls I have
not been able to examine, and of which no sufficient descriptions
exist. Of these, (7.) <i>C. galeatus</i> and (8.) <i>C. Gravesii</i> (<i>planirostris</i>)
would appear to be very distinct forms. (9.) <i>C. marginatus</i> is considered
by Duméril and Bibron to be only a variety of <i>C. vulgaris</i>;
and they take the same view of (10.) <i>Crocodilus suchus</i>. Professor
Owen, however, has figured the cranium of an Egyptian mummy
under this name ('Monograph on the Reptilia of the London Clay,'
Pal. Soc., 1850). In the under-view of this skull (tab. i. fig. 2), the
junction of the premaxilla and the maxilla in the palate seems to
be broken away; but on the left side, the palatine process of the
maxilla is entire, as far as the level of the anterior margin of the
sixth tooth, and there is not a trace of a suture behind this point.
Are there, then, two or more species of Crocodile in Egypt, as
Geoffroy St.-Hilaire supposed?</p>

<p>With regard to the distribution of the species of <i>Crocodilus</i>, <i>C.
vulgaris</i>, <i>C. marginatus</i>, and <i>C. suchus</i>(?) appear to be exclusively
African; all the crocodiles from other parts of the Eastern hemisphere,
which I have met with, belong, as I have stated above,
either to <i>C. biporcatus</i> or <i>C. bombifrons</i>, both of which species are
found in the Ganges. <i>Crocodilus galeatus</i> appears to be peculiar
to Siam. <i>Crocodilus Americanus</i> and <i>C. rhombifer</i> are undoubtedly
American. <i>C. Journei</i> has been supposed to be African; but
such positive evidence as exists tends rather to prove it to be an
American species. Thus Bory de St. Vincent states that the
Bordeaux specimen is "suspected to have come from America;"
and, as I have said, the skull in the British Museum is labelled
"from the Orinoko."</p>

<p><i>Crocodilus Gravesii</i> (<i>planirostris</i>) is supposed by Bory de St.
Vincent to have been brought from the Congo; but its real origin
is not known.</p>

<h3>Genus 5. <span class="smcap">Mecistops.</span></h3>

<p>The cranium is elongated, and the snout slender and Gavial-like.
There are eighteen slender and subequal teeth above, and fifteen
below, on each side. The mandibular symphysis extends back to
the level of the seventh tooth. The cervical scutes are arranged
in two transverse rows, each of which contains two scutes; and
there is no space left between the posterior row and the tergal series.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>This excellent genus, as established by Dr. Gray, includes Cuvier's
<i>Crocodilus cataphractus</i> (which Dr. Gray considers to be the young
of a species whose full-grown form was discovered by Mr. Bennett
in West Africa), <i>Crocodilus Journei</i> and <i>Crocodilus Schlegelii</i>.
As I have endeavoured to show, however, <i>C. Journei</i> is a true
crocodile; and, as I shall point out below, Müller and Schlegel
have satisfactorily proved <i>C. Schlegelii</i> to be a Gavial. Consequently
<i>Mecistops</i> is at present represented by only one species,
which must be called <i>M. cataphractus</i> if <i>M. Bennettii</i> of Gray is
really the adult of the form which Cuvier described.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>III. In the family of the <span class="smcap">Gavialidæ</span>, the snout is always very
long and slender; the teeth are for the most part slender, sharp-edged,
and subequal. The two anterior mandibular teeth pass into
grooves, one of which lies on each side of a beak-like prominence
of the premaxillæ, which carries the two anterior upper teeth.
The canines are received into grooves. The mandibular symphysis
extends back to at least the fourteenth tooth, and is partly formed
by the junction of the splenial bones. The premaxillo-maxillary
suture is always strongly convex backwards. The posterior nares
are situated more forward than in the <i>Crocodili</i>. The temporal
fossæ are large. The feet are strongly webbed. The dorsal scutes
are not articulated; and there are no ventral scutes.</p>

<p>I distinguish two genera in this family, <i>Rhynchosuchus</i> and
<i>Gavialis</i>.</p>

<h3>Genus 6. <span class="smcap">Rhynchosuchus.</span></h3>

<p>There are twenty teeth above, and eighteen or nineteen below,
on each side; the mandibular symphysis extends to the fifteenth
tooth. The posterior teeth of the upper jaw, and almost all those
of the lower jaw, are received into interdental pits; the orbital
margins are not raised; and the premaxillæ are hardly at all expanded.
The premaxillo-maxillary suture does not reach the third
tooth behind the notch.</p>

<p>I propose the name <i>Rhynchosuchus</i> to indicate that generic type
which is at present represented by the solitary species called by
Müller and Schlegel <i>Crocodilus</i> (<i>Gavialis</i>) <i>Schlegelii</i>, and admirably
described and figured by them in their essay, 'Over de
Krokodilen van der Indischen Archipel,' in the 'Verhandelingen
over de natuurlijke Gesch. der Nederl. overzee. Bezittingen,'
1839-1844. Under the title <i>Crocodilus</i> (<i>Gavialis</i>) <i>Schlegelii</i>
(p. 18), they say&mdash;"The Gavial from Borneo, when compared with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
the Indian one, is principally distinguished by the following
characters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. By its stronger form and better developed limbs.</p>

<p>2. By its much less slender head and snout, which last does
not narrow so suddenly in front of the eyes as in <i>G. Gangeticus</i>.</p>

<p>3. By the smaller number of teeth, of which there are twenty
above and eighteen below on each side, while <i>G. Gangeticus</i> has
<sup>28</sup>/<sub>26</sub> or <sup>27</sup>/<sub>25</sub>; furthermore, the teeth are stouter, less curved, and less
sharp, and are disposed more perpendicularly, and the ninth
tooth of the upper jaw (reckoning from the front) is considerably
larger and stronger than the others; whence it follows that, just
as in the true Crocodiles, the snout at the level of this tooth exhibits
a lateral projection.</p>

<p>4. By the shorter symphysis of the under jaw.</p>

<p>5. By the absence of the swollen nasal prominence (neusklep),
which characterizes the Gangetic Gavial.</p>

<p>6. By the less expanded form of the tabular upper surface of
the hinder part of the skull.</p>

<p>7. By the very slight production of the edges of the orbit.</p>

<p>8. By the large eyes.</p>

<p>9. By the presence of a number of small nuchal shields,
while <i>G. Gangeticus</i> has but one pair.</p>

<p>10. By the strongly developed keels of the dorsal scutes.</p>

<p>11. By the much larger scales on the under parts and on
the legs of the animal.</p>

<p>12. By the different colours with which it is variegated."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These authors further point out that the vomers appear for a
small space in the posterior part of the palate, that the opercular
or splenial bones join in the symphysis of the lower jaw, and that
the cervical and dorsal scutes form one continuous shield; and they
represent the two anterior mandibular teeth passing in grooves on
either side of the end of the premaxilla. In fact, they fully and
completely establish the fact that their new species belongs to the
<i>Longirostres</i> of Cuvier, or to the Gavials of later writers.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it is somewhat surprising to find
the deliberate conclusions of these careful investigators set aside
in the following brief passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This Bornean species (<i>C. Schlegelii</i>) was, in fact, originally
described as a new species of Gavial; but the nasal bones, as in
the fossil from Sheppey, figured in t. ii. 15, extend to the hinder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
border of the external nostril."&mdash;<i>Owen</i>, <i>Fossil Reptilia of the
London Clay, Crocodilia</i>, p. 15: 1850.</p></blockquote>

<p>Müller and Schlegel give remarkably clear and beautiful figures
of the skull of their Gavial; and these show at once that the nasal
bones do not "reach the hinder border of the external nostril,"
but meet the premaxillaries at a point very distant from that
border, viz. opposite the ninth tooth. Even did the nasal
bones reach the posterior boundary of the nostril, such a character
would not outweigh those derived from the relations and
number of the teeth, the structure and extent of the mandibular
symphysis, and the disposition of the dermal scutes,&mdash;all of which
are so clearly and definitely set forth by Müller and Schlegel, that
it seems difficult to understand how any one who had consulted
the original memoir could have overlooked them.</p>

<p>It was possible, however, that Müller and Schlegel, notwithstanding
their great opportunities, might have erred in their
statements; and I therefore gladly seized the opportunity of testing
their description by comparing it with an authentic skull of
the species in question, from New Guinea, in the collection of
the British Museum.</p>

<p>I have found the statement of Müller and Schlegel minutely
accurate in almost all points; and there cannot be the slightest
doubt, not only that the Schlegelian crocodile is one of the <i>Gavialidæ</i>,
but that it forms a distinct generic type in that family,
as different from <i>Gavialis</i> as <i>Caiman</i> is from <i>Jacare</i>, or <i>Mecistops</i>
from <i>Crocodilus</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following are the most important measurements of the skull
of <i>Rhynchosuchus Schlegelii</i> in the British Museum
collection:&mdash;</p>

<p>The face is very smooth; but a slight longitudinal groove runs
down on each side from the anterior margin of the orbit for about
two inches. Anteriorly to this point the snout retains a nearly
even diameter as far as the ninth tooth, in front of which it suddenly
narrows a little, retaining nearly the same dimensions to the
fourth tooth, where it widens a very little, and then suddenly
narrows to the terminal beak. The lower jaw does not expand at
all at its extremity. The nasals join the premaxillaries opposite
the ninth tooth, and the splenial bones, in the lower jaw, end opposite
the tenth mandibular tooth, as the figures of Müller and
Schlegel show. The vomers appear between the inner edges of the
palatines posteriorly, as a thin bony band 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch long by <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch
wide, which tapers at each end and is divided by a longitudinal
suture. The ninth tooth of the upper jaw is stronger than the rest.</p>

<p>The only point in which the description of Müller and Schlegel
seems to me to be incomplete<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> is with regard to the disposition of
the teeth. They say&mdash;"The teeth of <i>C. Schlegelii</i>, as regards
their form and development, more nearly resemble those of the
true Crocodiles; but in the way in which the teeth of the two
jaws are opposed, there is the most complete resemblance between
our species and the Gangetic Gavial,&mdash;both which species differ
from all other crocodiles in the circumstance that when the mouth
is shut, all the teeth of the under jaw project outside the lateral
margin of the upper jaw" (<i>l. c.</i> p. 22).</p>

<p>What I find is this:&mdash;The anterior teeth of both the upper jaw
and the mandible are long, slender, sharp-edged, and slightly
curved. The posterior eleven, on each side, in the upper jaw, are
short, straight, conical, and constricted below their crowns. There
are deep interdental pits between the ten posterior mandibular
teeth, into which the opposed teeth of the maxilla are received
when the jaws are closed. All the mandibular teeth, except the
two anterior and the fourth pair, pass into like pits in the upper
jaw. The anterior eight teeth on each side of the upper jaw pass
straight down outside the lower jaw. In the Gangetic Gavial the
relations of the teeth of the two jaws appear to me, as I shall
state below, to be very different.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p><i>Rhynchosuchus Schlegelii</i> inhabits the inland lakes of Borneo,
and is found in New Guinea.</p>

<h3>Genus 7. <span class="smcap">Gavialis.</span></h3>

<p>There are twenty-seven or twenty-eight teeth in the upper, and
twenty-five or twenty-six in the lower jaw. The mandibular symphysis
extends to the twenty-third or twenty-fourth tooth. The
lateral teeth of both jaws are, all but the very hindmost, directed
obliquely downwards (or upwards), forwards or outwards, and are
not received into interdental pits. The anterior margins of the
orbits are raised. The premaxillæ and the end of the mandible
are greatly expanded. The premaxillo-maxillary suture reaches
the level of the fourth tooth behind the canine notch.</p>

<p>The only true <i>Gavialis</i> is the well-known <i>G. Gangeticus</i> from the
East Indies. In this 'Gavial,' or 'Garrhial,' the vomers are slender
bones which do not extend further forwards than the level of the
twenty-second or twenty-first tooth, and have but a very short
and slender representative of the anterior flattened division of the
bone in <i>Jacare</i>; posteriorly they extend back to the level of the
descending processes of the prefrontals. In a skull 25 inches
long the vomers have a length of about 4 inches, extending as
they do a little further forward than the palato-maxillary suture.
The median nares are opposite the twenty-fifth tooth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All the <i>Crocodilia</i> which I have enumerated are provided with
two perfectly distinct kinds of dermal armour,&mdash;the one consisting
of plates of horn, produced by a modification of the superficial
layer of the epidermis; the other composed of discs of bone marked
by a peculiar pitted sculpture on their outer surfaces, and developed
within the substance of the dermis. To the former I shall
apply the term "scales;" the latter are what I have denominated
"scutes."</p>

<p>All recent <i>Crocodilia</i> have both scales and scutes in the dorsal
region of the body, the scutes underlying, and having the same
general form as the scales. In all, the ventral region of the body
is also covered with scales which have a very definite shape; but
in no recent Crocodilian which I have examined, save those species
which are included in the genera <i>Caiman</i> and <i>Jacare</i>, are there
any scutes in the ventral region.</p>

<p>Again, in the genera <i>Alligator</i>, <i>Crocodilus</i>, <i>Mecistops</i>, Rhynchosuchus,
and <i>Gavialis</i>, the edges of the scutes, except those of the
two median longitudinal rows, are hardly ever united by sutures,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
nor do the posterior margins of those in each transverse row overlap
the anterior margins of the succeeding row. At any rate, there is
no flat, bevelled, articular facet on the outer surface of the anterior
margin of a scute, for articulation with the inner surface of the
posterior margin of its predecessor. In the genera <i>Caiman</i> and
<i>Jacare</i>, however, the lateral edges of all the scutes of the dorsal
and ventral shields are united by serrated sutures; and the anterior
end of the outer face of each is provided with a well-marked smooth
facet, which is overlapped by the smooth under-surface of the
scute in front of it.</p>

<p>I first noticed the remarkable structure of the dermal armour
of these <i>Alligatoridæ</i> in the skin of a <i>Jacare</i> (<i>sp. incerta</i>), wanting
the end of the tail, but which must have belonged to an animal
between five and six feet in length. It had long been in my possession;
but I had never before had occasion to study its characters
minutely.</p>

<p>The horny scales, which had the appearance of thin tortoise-shell,
could be readily peeled off (especially by the aid of a little
caustic potash); and then the white surface of the subjacent
bony scute upon which they were modelled came into view. It
is to be understood, however, that the inner surface of the scale
corresponded only in its general form with the outer surface of
the scute; for it did not dip into the pits with which the latter
is sculptured. These are in fact filled by the dry dermis which
extends over and encloses the scute, a very thin layer (bearing the
rete mucosum) being interposed between it and the scale; so that
the pitted sculpture does not come out well until the scutes have
been boiled.</p>

<p>The <i>dorsal</i> scutes are both carinated and angulated. By the
application of the former term, I mean to indicate that, along a
median or submedian longitudinal line, their substance is more
or less elevated, so as, in many cases, to form a very prominent
crest. This crest always subsides before it reaches the anterior
margin of the scute, though it may extend beyond the posterior
margin. Its highest point is always behind the centre of the
scute, and is devoid of sculpture. The sculpture however seems
to radiate from this point, inasmuch as it consists, on the greater
part of the scute, of distinct pits, which are usually round towards
the centre, but towards the periphery become ovals with their
long axes directed towards the point in question.</p>

<p>The smooth inner surfaces of the scute shelve towards a depression
which corresponds with the external ridge, under which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
sides of the scute seem to meet in an angle. This may be called
the 'angulation' of the scute. From before backwards, the inner
surface of the scute is a little convex. The scute is thickest in the
middle; posteriorly, it thins off to an edge and overlaps its successor;
anteriorly, its outer surface is bevelled off at an acute angle
with the inner, so as to give rise to a smooth shelving surface&mdash;wide
from side to side, narrow from before backwards&mdash;forming the
'articular facet,' which is overlapped by the inner surface of the
posterior edge of the preceding scute. I have termed this the
'articular facet;' but it must not be supposed that there is anything
like a true joint between the opposed facets of the overlapping
and overlapped scutes; on the contrary, they are at once
separated and connected by the dermal connective tissue.</p>

<p>The posterior margin of the articular facet is separated by a
deep transverse groove, divided by little partitions into as many pits,
from the rest of the sculptured surface; but there is no trace of
any suture dividing the scute into two portions. The lateral
margins of each scute are united by serrated sutural edges with
those which lie next to them in the same transverse row; so that
each row forms a nearly solid flat bony bar, composed, in the middle
of the back, of as many as ten distinct scutes. The outer edges
of the outermost scutes only, thin off and exhibit no sutural serration,
inasmuch as they are not directly connected with <span class="smcap">any</span> other
scutes.</p>

<p>The median line of the back corresponds in general with the
suture between the two middle scutes of each transverse row; so
that the scutes are disposed symmetrically on either side of that
line. Furthermore, the anterior part of the inner surface of each
of the two middle scutes is connected by ligament with the extremity
of the spinous process of a vertebra; at least, this is the
case in the dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and anterior caudal regions.</p>

<p>The scutes which protect the <i>ventral</i> side of the body, from
the throat backwards, are four-sided and similar in their ornamentation
to the dorsal scutes; but they exhibit neither ridge nor
angulation, their outer and inner surfaces being parallel, and either
nearly flat or evenly curved. Each forms, in fact, a segment of a
large cylinder, inasmuch as the whole ventral shield is convex
transversely, being nearly flat in the middle and much bent up at
the sides. The dorsal shield, taken as a whole, is, on the contrary,
nearly flat. The lateral edges of the ventral scutes interlock
suturally; and their anterior and posterior edges are overlapped
and overlap, just like the dorsal scutes. The outer edges of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
outermost ventral scutes thin off and are not united with any
bony element; and the ventral, like the dorsal scutes, are usually
arranged symmetrically on either side of the median sutural line.
There may be as many as twenty-two scutes united by their lateral
sutures into a single strong, curved, transverse, bony, bar-like
segment of the ventral armour.</p>

<p>Throughout the neck and body, and as far as the commencement
of the tail, the ends of the dorsal and ventral bony bars, whose
sum may be regarded as a dorsal and a ventral shield respectively,
are separated by an interval of integument, in which only small
scattered scutes are visible. The physiological import of this
arrangement becomes obvious when we consider in what manner
the animal breathes; and indeed the integumentary interval
answers very precisely to the leather which connects the two
boards of a bellows. Again, though the limbs are themselves
covered with articulated scutes, they are afforded free play upon
the body by this flexible interspace. Immediately behind the
hind legs, the ventral and dorsal shields unite; and the tail is from
that point surrounded by a succession of bony hoops, each of
which corresponds with a vertebra, the segments of the exoskeleton
answering to those of the endoskeleton.</p>

<p>The most remarkable feature about the ventral scutes, however,
and that in which they differ most widely from the dorsal ones, consists
in the fact that each scute is composed of two distinct pieces,
an anterior and a posterior, which unite together by a transverse
serrated suture. The anterior piece or 'semi-scute' may attain
to three-quarters the length of the posterior, and it has exactly the
same width. The anterior semi-scute bears the articular facet and
the transverse pitted groove, whose posterior wall is just in front
of its hinder edge, or in other words, of the suture, when the two
semi-scutes are united.</p>

<p>Such are the general characters and mode of arrangement of the
dorsal and ventral armour of <i>Jacare</i>. But there remain many
noteworthy peculiarities in the disposition and number of the
components of each band of the armour.</p>

<p>Thus, in the <i>dorsal shield</i> there are two rows of nuchal scutes,
each containing eight separate keeled bony plates; and of cervical
scutes there are five rows, the two anterior of which contain four
angulated and carinated scutes each, while the three posterior contain
only two scutes each. All these scutes, except the anterior
row, have articular facets; and all those of each row are united
suturally. Of dorsal scutes there are thirty transverse rows up to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the median keel of the tail, which commences with the thirty-first
row. The number of scutes in each row is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Throughout the dorso-lumbar and sacral regions (<i>i. e.</i> up to the
nineteenth row), the median scutes are hardly keeled at all, while
the outer ones are the more strongly carinate the more external
they lie.</p>

<p>In the caudal region, the second scute from the middle line, in
the twenty-third row, has a strong keel and angulation, which
grows stronger in the corresponding scutes up to the thirtieth
inclusive, until the superior and lateral faces of these scutes, in the
twenty-ninth and thirtieth rows, are inclined to one another at a
right angle and very strongly keeled. I have said that, as a rule,
the median line is occupied by a suture between two median scutes;
but in the caudal region<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>, in the twenty-fifth row (which corresponds
with the sixth caudal vertebra) the two median scutes are
replaced by one flat scute, so that there is no suture in the middle
line. In the twenty-sixth row there is a similar arrangement, but
the flat scute is smaller; and in the twenty-seventh no trace of it
is left, so that the strongly keeled lateral scutes meet in the middle
line, which is again occupied by a suture. This continues up to
the thirty-first row, when the median scute reappears as a thin
vertical plate, broader below and in front, where it articulates with
the median lateral scutes, than above and behind, where it exhibits
a free edge only covered by the horny epidermis. It is thus that
the serrated dorsal crest of the tail is formed. The scutes of the
crest exhibit only very small round and distant pits.</p>

<p>The <i>ventral shield</i> begins in the neck just behind the level of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
the anterior margins of the orbits: the fifteen anterior rows may
be termed subcervical, as they lie in front of the thorax. In the
first six rows the scutes are very small, and increase in number up
to twelve in a row. In the next six rows there are ten scutes
in a row, and in the last three, twelve. All these rows are symmetrically
divided by the median line. In the three hinder rows
the inner scutes are longer than the outer ones; and this is most
markedly the case in the fifteenth row, whose innermost scute is
half as long again as the corresponding one of the preceding row,
and more than three times as long as the outermost of its own
row.</p>

<p>The sixteenth row differs from its predecessors and successors,
and may be termed the axillary row. It is bent upon itself with
an angle open forwards, and is divided into two halves (each of
which contains seven scutes) by the union of the middle scutes of
the fifteenth subcervical with those of the first row of what may
be termed the subdorsal scutes, or those which lie under the
thorax and abdomen. Of subdorsal and subcaudal scutes there
are, up to the broken-off end of the tail, thirty-seven rows, with the
following numbers of scutes:&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be noticed that there are three more rows of ventral
than of dorsal scutes. On endeavouring to ascertain how this
came about, I observed that the first subdorsal was a good deal
behind the first dorsal row, though the eighth to the twelfth
dorsal corresponded exactly with the eighth to the twelfth ventral
rows. In the anterior part of the body, therefore, there is a clear
general correspondence between the segments of the dorsal and
those of the ventral armour.</p>

<p>In the caudal region, again, I found that the twenty-fourth ventral
row, which is the first of the caudal rows not excavated by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
vent, corresponded exactly with the twenty-first dorsal row. It
was clear, therefore, that three ventral rows wore interpolated
somewhere between the twelfth and twenty-first dorsal rows; and
on close examination I found this interpolation to arise from the
doubling of the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth ventral rows.</p>

<p>I have examined <i>Jacare fissipes</i> and <i>nigra</i>, <i>Caiman trigonatus</i>,
and <i>C. gibbiceps</i>, in the British Museum; and I find, in all, dorsal
and ventral armour having the same essential arrangement as
that just described. A specimen of <i>Caiman palpebrosus</i> about
two feet long, the opportunity of examining which I owe to Dr.
Grant, exhibits the dorsal and ventral shields (whose scutes are in
the main similarly arranged) very beautifully; and a young <i>Jacare</i>
of about 18 inches in length, for which I am indebted to the kindness
of the same gentleman, proves that the scutes are developed
even in specimens of this age. I have no hesitation therefore in
expressing my belief that this singularly complete dermal armour
will be found to be characteristic of all the species of the genera
<i>Caiman</i> and <i>Jacare</i>. On the other hand, I have examined <i>Alligator
Mississipiensis</i>, <i>Crocodilus vulgaris</i>, <i>C. biporcatus</i>, <i>C. Americanus</i>,
<i>C. rhombifer</i>, and <i>C. bombifrons</i>, <i>Mecistops cataphractus</i>,
and <i>Gavialis Gangeticus</i>, of various ages and sizes, without having
been able to discover a trace of ventral scutes. This is the more
remarkable, as the well-marked ventral and dorsal shields of many
of the ancient <i>Teleosauria</i> would lead one to expect a corresponding
exoskeleton (if anywhere) in their nearest allies, the modern
<i>Gavialidæ</i>. However, <i>Goniopholis</i>, with its strong armour, is
more like an ordinary Crocodile; and I have recently discovered
that a true Crocodile in some respects curiously similar to <i>C. bombifrons</i>
(<i>C. Hastingsiæ</i>) was covered with scutes exceedingly like
those of the modern <i>Caiman</i> and <i>Jacare</i>.</p>

<p>In minute structure the bony scutes of <i>Jacare</i> closely resemble
those of such a fish as a Sturgeon: a middle layer, containing
so many canals as to appear almost cancellated in longitudinal
or transverse section, is covered externally by a thin, and
internally by a thick, layer composed of bony lamellæ, nearly parallel
to the plane of the scute. Round the canals of the middle
layer, the bony lamellæ are disposed concentrically, to a greater or
less extent. The lacunæ are of very various shapes; and there are
perhaps as many short as elongated forms. The canals of the
middle layer communicate by large branches with the inner, by
smaller and fewer branches with the outer surface of the scute.</p>

<p>In the young <i>Jacare</i> mentioned above, I found the dermis to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
distinguishable into two layers. The more superficial of these is
thin, made up of irregular or formless connective tissue, and contains
many ramified pigment-masses. Its smooth outer surface underlies
the rete mucosum. Internally, it passes into the second or
deep layer, which consists of successive layers of distinctly fibrous
connective tissue, disposed in definite parallel bundles, and having
a very regular arrangement. Throughout a space corresponding
with the area of each scale, in fact, the bundles of each layer cross
those of the succeeding layer at right angles; and the successive
tiers of bundles are tied together by short cords disposed perpendicularly
to the planes of the tiers. A corresponding arrangement of
the bundles of connective tissue has long been known to obtain
in the dermis of Fishes and <i>Batrachia</i>. At each end of this small
"mat" of connective tissue, the bundles, if I may so say, fray out;
and at the anterior end, the layers, loosened in texture, bend upwards,
spreading out at the same time to become continuous with
the fibres of the "mat" in front. In consequence of the matting
under the quadrate surface of each scale, the dermis has a peculiar
facetted aspect, quite apart from any osseous deposit. Where
bony scutes are formed, they appear as very thin perforated plates
in the most superficial portion of the deep layer of the dermis; so
that there is a single thin layer of dense connective tissue above
them, while below them are all the rest of the denser and deeper
lamellæ of the dermis. Through the apertures in this primitive
osseous plate (the rudiment of the middle layer of the future
scute), bundles of connective tissue extend, connecting the deep
with the superjacent lamellæ.</p>

<p>If a thin section is made and decalcified with weak acid under
the microscope, the calcareous matter, as it is dissolved away, leaves
an obscurely fibrous matrix of a different aspect from the surrounding
connective tissue, and the endoplasts, or nuclei, of this
matrix are seen each to have occupied the centre of a lacuna.</p>

<p>Again, the rudimentary scute lies in the dermis as in a sort of
pocket, the superficial and deep walls of which separate from it
with great ease; and in good thin sections made through the dermis
and scute, there seems to be no direct connexion between the
substance of the scute above and below, and the connective tissue
with which it is in contact. Nor could I satisfy myself that the
margins of the scute were continuous with the surrounding bundles
of connective tissue. However, the specimen had been a very
long time in spirit; and I am unwilling to lay too much stress
upon these observations, which tend to negative the supposition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
that the scute proceeds from the direct calcification of the connective
tissue of the dermis.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I must remark that horizontal sections of
the scutes have presented oblique parallel fissures, sometimes
crossing one another, which might readily be supposed to correspond
with the lines of separation of ossified bundles of connective
tissue.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;During a recent visit to Paris, my friend Mr. Busk
was kind enough to examine the specimens of recent <i>Crocodilia</i> in
the Museum of the Jardin des Plantes, with reference to certain
points to which I requested his attention. Mr. Busk informs me
that there is no doubt about the transverse direction of the premaxillo-maxillary
suture in <i>Crocodilus rhombifer</i>; and his statements
lead me to entertain no question that <i>C. bombifrons</i> is a
synonym of <i>C. palustris</i>.</p>

<p>In the typical specimens of <i>C. marginatus</i> and <i>C. suchus</i> of
Geoffroy St.-Hilaire, the premaxillo-maxillary suture extends back
to the level of the seventh tooth.</p>

<p>Mr. Busk has furthermore pointed out to me the existence of
another American species of Crocodile&mdash;<i>C. Morelettii</i>, which has
been described by M. Auguste Duméril in his "Description des
Reptiles nouveaux ou imparfaitement connus," &amp;c., 'Archives
du Muséum,' t. vi. 1852.</p>

<p>This species inhabits lake Flores, in Yucatan; and it is said by
M. Duméril to approach <i>C. Americanus</i>, from which it differs in
the proportions of the skull and in the characters of the dermal
armour.</p>

<p class="center">[Read April 7th, 1859.]</p>

<p class="right">"Mauritius, Jan. 27, 1859.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"My dear Mr. Owen,</span>&mdash;After very great difficulty and much
delay, I have at length obtained a fine healthy male adult <i>Aye-Aye</i>;
and he is now enjoying himself in a large cage which I have had
constructed for him.</p>

<p>He is a most interesting little animal; and from close observation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
I have learnt his habits very correctly. On receiving him
from Madagascar, I was told that he ate bananas; so of course I
fed him on them, but tried him with other fruit. I found he liked
dates,&mdash;which was a grand discovery, supposing he be sent alive to
England. Still I thought that those strong rodent teeth, as large
as those of a young Beaver, must have been intended for some
other purpose than that of trying to eat his way out of a cage&mdash;the
only use he seemed to make of them, besides masticating soft
fruits. Moreover, he had other peculiarities,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, singularly large,
naked ears directed forward, as if for offensive rather than defensive
purposes; then, again, the second finger of the hands is unlike
anything but a monster supernumerary member, it being slender
and long, half the thickness of the other fingers, and resembling
a piece of bent wire. Excepting the head and this finger, he
closely resembles a Lemur.</p>

<p>Now as he attacked, every night, the woodwork of his cage,
which I was gradually lining with tin, I bethought myself of
tying some sticks over the woodwork, so that he might gnaw
these instead. I had previously put in some large branches for
him to climb upon; but the others were straight sticks to cover
over the woodwork of his cage, which <i>alone</i> he attacked. It so
happened that the thick sticks I now put into his cage were bored
in all directions by a large and destructive grub called here the
<i>Moutouk</i>. Just at sunset the Aye-Aye crept from under his
blanket, yawned, stretched, and betook himself to his tree, where
his movements are lively and graceful, though by no means so
quick as those of a squirrel. Presently he came to one of the
worm-eaten branches, which he began to examine most attentively;
and bending forward his ears, and applying his nose close to the
bark, he rapidly tapped the surface with the curious second digit,
as a woodpecker taps a tree, though with much less noise, from
time to time inserting the end of the slender finger into the
worm-holes, as a surgeon would a probe. At length he came to a
part of the branch which evidently gave out an interesting sound,
for he began to tear it with his strong teeth. He rapidly stripped
off the bark, cut into the wood, and exposed the nest of a grub,
which he daintily picked out of its bed with the slender tapping
finger, and conveyed the luscious morsel to his mouth.</p>

<p>I watched these proceedings with intense interest, and was
much struck with the marvellous adaptation of the creature to its
habits, shown by his acute hearing, which enables him aptly to
distinguish the different tones emitted from the wood by his gentle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
tapping; his evidently acute sense of smell, aiding him in his
search; his secure footsteps on the slender branches, to which he
firmly clung by his quadrumanous members; his strong rodent
teeth, enabling him to tear through the wood; and lastly by the
curious slender finger, unlike that of any other animal, and which
he used alternately as a pleximeter, a probe, and a scoop.</p>

<p>But I was yet to learn another peculiarity. I gave him water
to drink in a saucer, on which he stretched out a hand, dipped a
finger into it, and drew it obliquely through his open mouth; and
this he repeated so rapidly, that the water seemed to flow into his
mouth. After a while he lapped like a cat; but his first mode of
drinking appeared to me to be his way of reaching water in the
deep clefts of trees.</p>

<p>I am told that the <i>Aye-Aye</i> is an object of veneration at Madagascar,
and that if any native touches one, he is sure to die within
the year; hence the difficulty of obtaining a specimen. I overcame
this scruple by a reward of £10.</p>

<p>I quite despair of obtaining the bones of the <i>Dinornis</i> or <i>Dodo</i>,
though I have made every effort. I shall always be proud to be
of service.</p>

<h2 id="ON_THE_MOULTING_OF_THE_COMMON_LOBSTER" class="chapt">On the Moulting of the common Lobster (<i>Homarus vulgaris</i>) and
Shore Crab (<i>Carcinus mænas</i>). By <span class="smcap">S. James A. Salter</span>,
M.B., F.L.S., F.G.S.</h2>

<p class="center">[Read April 7th, 1859.]</p>

<p>I am induced to bring this subject before the Linnean Society, on
account of the singularly perfect specimen of the thrown-off slough
of a Lobster which I have now an opportunity of exhibiting, and
because the process by which it was shed was witnessed and carefully
watched by two competent observers&mdash;by my friend Mr.
Robert Cooke, of Scarborough, a Fellow of this Society, and by
the intelligent wife of the Curator of the Scarborough Museum,
in an aquarium in which institution the occurrence took place.</p>

<p>The methods by which certain of the Decapod Crustaceans cast
their old shells in the process of renewal and growth have already
been made the subject of observation and record.</p>

<p>Réaumur, as early as 1712, and again in 1718, saw and described
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
the sloughing of the common freshwater Crayfish (<i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>).</p>

<p>It was witnessed in the common edible Crab (<i>Cancer Pagurus</i>)
by Mr. Couch, in 1833.</p>

<p>Subsequently the moulting-process was observed by Mr. Gosse,
in the Spinous Spider-crab (<i>Maia Squinado</i>).</p>

<p>Beyond these three recorded examples, I believe that the actual
operation of moulting in Decapods has never been seen, though
the sloughs of our common Crustacea, and the animals themselves
but recently emerged from their old shells, are familiar to all
marine zoologists.</p>

<p>There is no recorded account of the moulting of the Lobster,
that I have been able to discover.</p>

<p>The Lobster from which the slough was obtained, and whose
operations are the subject of this communication, was an inhabitant
of a large marine aquarium in the Museum at Scarborough.
The period was July 1857. The aquarium contained the ordinary
assemblage of sea-shore animals, and a considerable collection of
vegetation, which consisted of <i>Ulva</i>, <i>Fucus</i>, and other common
sea-weeds.</p>

<p>For two days previous to its throwing off the shell, the Lobster
was observed in a very peculiar attitude, and to be very busily engaged.
Its abdomen was permanently and stiffly erected and
straight; while the animal, in this rigid attitude, was hard at work
detaching and carrying all the soft sea-weed it could collect to
one end of the aquarium, where it thus accumulated a large mass
of vegetation, which was afterwards destined to become a screen
and protection for its soft body. At the same time, and by the
same means, a clearing was made at the other end of the tank, in
which it had space for the evolutions which were subsequently
necessary for the extrication of its body.</p>

<p>The Lobster remained in the peculiar rigid attitude I have
described, during the entire two days previous to the moult. On
the third day, a crack was observed along the membrane which
unites the dorsal surface of the first abdominal ring with the
carapace; and when these parts became separated by about half an
inch, the bright-blue membrane of the new shell being plainly
visible beneath, the operation of extricating the abdomen commenced.
By a strong vibratory action of the whole abdomen,
principally in a lateral direction, one segment was, at first, protruded
through the split; and this was followed by an interval of
complete repose, during which the animal remained quite motionless.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Then, by another vibratory action, the second segment
was extricated; then followed an interval of repose, when the
third was withdrawn; and so on till, at last, the entire abdomen,
after having been bent double upon itself, was turned completely
out backwards, and then, elongated and compressed, remained
above and parallel to the empty shell that it had occupied, and
which was still attached to the under surface of the cephalothorax.
Hitherto the only orifice of escape consisted in the transverse
splitting of the first abdominal segment from the carapace, on the
dorsal surface. None of the abdominal segments separated from
each other.</p>

<p>Thus far the extrication had commenced at the front of the
abdomen, and had progressed from before backwards. It was now
observed that the carapace had split from behind forwards, the fissure
commencing posteriorly at the transverse split between <i>the</i>
carapace and the first abdominal segment, and reaching forwards
to the apex of the rostrum, which, however, it did not absolutely
divide. The two halves of the carapace then separating posteriorly,
the interval between them, together with the original transverse
slit, constituted a trifid opening, through which the rest of the
animal escaped.</p>

<p>The escape of the cephalo-thoracic portion was effected from behind
forwards. First the posterior ambulatory legs were loosened
and withdrawn; then followed the next pair; and this process
was continued from behind forwards, pair by pair&mdash;the withdrawal
of each pair of legs being followed by an interval of repose. The
limbs were withdrawn very readily from the old shell, slipping out
of it as a leg would from a loose boot. No apparent effort accompanied
these operations so far.</p>

<p>The extrication of the claws, however, was attended with much
and violent exertion. This consisted of two powerful and sudden
tugs, the soft abdomen of the Lobster pressing by its under surface
upon the upper surface of the empty shell. By this means the
soft chelæ were drawn through the narrow joints of the old shell,
exhibiting strong, unmistakeable marks of the violence and pressure
to which they had been subjected. The escape of the chelæ
from their unyielding incasement was not aided by any splitting
of the old shell, the large soft hands being drawn by compression
through the narrow joints, as a wire is drawn through the contracting
holes of a draw-plate.</p>

<p>The efforts for the withdrawal of the chelæ were the last, and
succeeded in completely freeing the Lobster from its old case.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Not only the claws, but the parts of the mouth, the antennæ, and
the eyes, were all unsheathed; and with the last tug the regenerate
Lobster plunged backwards, and entirely escaped, above and behind
the now empty shell&mdash;its former tenement.</p>

<p>The operation, from first to last, occupied about twenty minutes,
and was performed entirely in view, in that part of the aquarium
which the Lobster had cleared of sea-weed.</p>

<p>Immediately after emerging from the old shell, the Lobster, was
much deformed: there was a general elongation of the whole
animal; but this was most remarkably the case with the claws,
which were quite drawn out of shape. During the few subsequent
hours, both the body and the claws became shorter and much
enlarged. This increase of size did not result from any unfolding
of membrane of the shell previously plicated, as no folds were observable
immediately after the emergence of the animal, but from
a simple distension, apparently from the imbibition, either by
swallowing or by endosmosis, of considerable quantities of water.
The membrane of the new shell was perfectly soft, and of a bright
blue colour. At first the Lobster was shy and quite inactive,
retiring to and remaining concealed among the accumulated sea-weed;
but in a few hours it emerged from its retreat, and moved
freely about the aquarium. The membrane of the new shell remained
soft for some days, but on the seventh it appeared to
have become perfectly calcified.</p>

<p>These are the details of the exuviation of the Lobster whose
cast-off shell is before the Society. By a happy accident, the
same observers had an opportunity of witnessing the sloughing
of another Lobster, in the month of November following. The
process was identically the same in every particular; but it was
observed that the subsequent calcification of the shell did not take
place till after the lapse of about fourteen days,&mdash;a circumstance
probably dependent on a lower temperature and a less active
nutrition. These are, I believe, the only two instances in which
the exuviation of the Lobster has been actually witnessed; but
there exist specimens of sloughs which are entirely in keeping
with this description. In the fish-house of the Zoological Society
of London there are two specimens which were cast in the tanks
there; and in each there is the same transverse splitting of the
carapace from the abdomen, and the longitudinal splitting of the
carapace itself, without any other opening for the escape of the
animal.</p>

<p>One or two general observations are suggested by the foregoing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
description. In the only examples of the exuviation of macrourous
Decapod Crustaceans, there exists a singular diversity in the
process itself. In <i>Astacus</i>, as described by Réaumur, the process
commences with the escape of the cephalothorax; in <i>Homarus</i>, as
I have now described it, it begins by the emergence of the abdomen.
In <i>Astacus</i> the carapace is detached and thrown off bodily
and unbroken, being severed from its attachments with the lateral
portions of the cephalothorax, as is the case in the Brachyura;
whereas in <i>Homarus</i> the lateral attachments of the carapace
remain, whilst the plate itself is split up the centre. In <i>Astacus</i>,
as is also the case in the Brachyura, the thrown-off slough is uniformly
left resting on its dorsal surface; in <i>Homarus</i> the reverse
is uniformly the case. But the most striking dissimilarity is
to be found in the circumstances <i>stated</i> to attend the liberation
of the chelæ. Prof. Bell, in the Introduction to his 'History of
the British Stalk-eyed Crustacea,' remarks&mdash;"It is impossible to
imagine that the crust of the legs, and especially of the great
claws of the larger species, could be cast off, unless it were
susceptible of being longitudinally split" (p. 35), and he then
proceeds to give the account detailed by Réaumur of the longitudinal
splitting of the shell in the neighbourhood of the joints of
the claws in <i>Astacus</i>, so as to allow of the extrication of the hands.
Nevertheless, however impossible it may appear for the chelæ to
escape without this splitting, no such circumstance occurs in the
exuviation of <i>Homarus vulgaris</i>; and when we consider that the
hands of <i>Astacus</i> are small in proportion to the wrist-joints, and
that in <i>Homarus</i> they are larger in proportion to those joints than
in any other of the Macroura, this dissimilarity in the mode in
which the claws escape is the more remarkable, and, I confess, to
my own mind it suggests the suspicion that the distinguished and
usually most accurate French naturalist to whom I have referred
may possibly in this instance have been led to consider as a fact
that which was to him a supposed necessity<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>.</p>

<p>Since the foregoing account of the moulting of the Lobster was
written, I have dredged a specimen of the common shore-crab
(<i>Carcinus mænas</i>), in the act of casting its shell. This little
crustacean had taken refuge, no doubt for the safe and secret performance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
of sloughing in a forest of <i>Zostera</i>, on one of the mud
banks in Poole Harbour, and while scraping these weeds with a
keer-drag it fortunately fell into my net. It shows how the Brachyura
leave their old shells by the horizontal splitting away of the
carapace from the other portions of the shell&mdash;the carapace itself
remaining entire; and it also shows (and this was my principal
object in exhibiting the specimen) the enormous amount of increase
of size upon emerging from the shell, and the rapidity with which
that increase takes place. The animal, as now seen, is in exactly
the same state as when taken out of the water, and its bulk is
probably some four times larger than the area of the shell in which
it had been encased only a few minutes before. I retained the
Crab in connexion with its old shell, and prevented its further
escape by wrapping it in paper, so that it could not move its limbs.
I thought such a specimen would be telling and illustrative, and that
the old shell, being in contact with the new, would afford facilities
for contrast. In this condition the Crab died, and, being out of water
some time, it became dry, and the soft new shell collapsed and
bulged in; but, upon placing the dead Crab in sea-water, the soft
shell very speedily imbibed sufficient fluid to distend it to its previous
dimensions. This of course was simply the effect of endosmosis.
Mr. Couch, in describing the moulting of the common Edible Crab
(<i>Cancer Pagurus</i>), speaks of its <i>drinking</i> large quantities of water,
and <i>thus</i> becoming distended; but I rather think that the distension
takes place by endosmosis, even during life. There are two circumstances
which militate against Mr. Couch's opinion:&mdash;first,
the rapidity with which the distension occurred in the Crab I have
just exhibited, while still in the act of moulting; and secondly,
that after death the same distension occurred when the Crab was
immersed in sea-water; in which case it could only be by endosmosis.
Indeed to me it seems very probable that this very endosmosis,
when the water once comes in contact with the new, uncalcified
shell, may, by distending it, be the main agent in the breaking
open and dissevering of the elements of the old shell.</p>

<h2 id="ON_THE_SHELL-BEARING_MOLLUSCA" class="chapt">On the Shell-bearing Mollusca, particularly with regard to Structure
and Form.  By <span class="smcap">Robert Garner</span>, Esq., F.L.S.</h2>

<p class="center">[Abstract of a Paper read before the Society.]</p>

<p>The author commences the paper, of which the following is the
substance, with some general observations on the morphology of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
animals. He thinks that the idea of an ascending and successive
scale or chain of creation is, in the main, correct, when the great
classes, and not species or genera, are made the links,&mdash;the disturbing
or modifying influences being due to modes of life, food,
habitat, &amp;c., and causing a different (say the quinary) distribution.
He is an advocate, too, for the doctrine of one fundamental plan
of organization, and thinks that, in the zoophyte, there is a real
union of both the animal and vegetable <i>nisus</i>.</p>

<p>The great divisions of this chain, the <i>radiate</i>, <i>articulate</i>, <i>molluscous</i>,
and <i>vertebrate</i>, constitute an ascending series; the links of
the chain, so to speak, being in each case, for such an extent, of a
particular pattern; but, nevertheless, one of the highest mollusks
may surpass in organization one of the lowest fishes, or an articulate
creature a mollusk. The author considers such great divisions
of animals, as well as minor ones&mdash;the gasteropodous mollusks, for
instance&mdash;as realities, and not mere abstractions; and that they
are independent of the circumstances of food, habitat, locomotion,
&amp;c., just referred to. So great, however, are these disturbing
influences, that they often produce an extraordinary external
resemblance or pseudo-analogy between animals of a very different
nature, as between a <i>Chiton</i> and an <i>Oniscus</i>, and they are connected
intimately with, though not the cause of, what we call
specific or generic distinctions. Aërial life, in contradistinction to
aquatic, raises much the character of the locomotive organs; yet
this is subordinate to type: hence the creeping Mollusk appears
to have commonly a higher organization than the flying Insect.</p>

<p>The cartilages of <i>Sepia</i> have a true resemblance to those of
a Skate, and the Cirrhipede truly connects the Mollusk with the
Crustacean. The author regards <i>Dentalium</i> as a gasteropod, differing
in this respect from Lacaze-Duthiers, whose beautiful paper,
however, renders it supererogatory to say anything more on this
animal, except that the author believes that the presence of the
spiniferous tongue, of a proboscis, and the nature of the food, are
favourable to his view: he also takes the feathery tufts to be the
branchiæ.</p>

<p>The anatomy of <i>Aspergillum</i> is similar to that of <i>Pholas</i>;
its mantle, however, is all but closed in front, and ends in an
obliquely-set muscular disk, applied to the internal surface of the
rose of the so-called <i>arrosoir</i>, the openings of this part of the shell
giving exit to certain processes and fimbriæ of the fleshy disk,&mdash;a
narrow slit being also left in both the muscular and shelly disks
for the exsertion of the small, compressed and curved foot. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
animal is enveloped within the shell by a rather horny, general
membrane.</p>

<p>The author touches upon the anatomy of some other genera of
Lamellibranchiata. <i>Solemya</i> has its firm, horny, dark cuticle
doubled inwards from the valves over the tubular mantle; behind,
it has an anal opening, and a second fringed branchial slit lower
down: the branchiæ and tentacles are single on each side, the
former being remarkably feather-like. The foot is similar to that of
the Solens, but crenate round its anterior disk. <i>Cyrenoidea</i> has the
mantle closed below, but with two openings behind, the upper one
with a semicircular internal fringe, incomplete above; a callous
rim and fringe surround the mantle, which has also a third opening
for the long, compressed, bent, and blunt foot. This last has a
remarkable crystalline body, directed from the stomach to the
pedal pore, apparently, as in <i>Cardium</i>, subserving by its elasticity
to the extension of the foot, and consequently to locomotion; at
any rate, it is not a sexual distinction. The external branchiæ are
short, and the upper or internal branchial cavity does not communicate
with the lower one. The renal organ opens near the
branchial nerve, and the ovary at the base of the abdominal mass.
<i>Trigonia</i> is remarkable for its beautifully fringed, open mantle, its
pectinated pits for the secretion of the teeth, and the large scythe-shaped
foot, trenchant before and peaked behind, and having a
fringed disk. <i>Vulsella</i> is allied to the Oyster, but more so to the
Pectens, having a small cylindrical grooved foot and appended
visceral mass, but no byssus; the rectum perforates the heart, and
has a tentacle above its opening. <i>Perna</i> has a similar foot, and a
very bulky byssus, with a large muscle attached to their base; the
lips resemble those of the Oyster. The anatomy of <i>Crania</i> is little
different from that of <i>Orbicula</i>, as described by Owen,&mdash;the beautiful
arms folded in several coils, with a simple mouth at their base,
the stomach and short intestinal canal surrounded by the liver and
hearts, and terminating by a lateral bend; the ovaries ramifying in
the mantle; the adductor muscles being four in number, with some
bands to the mantle; and on the latter, glandular markings corresponding
with the microscopic sculpture of the shell. With
respect to <i>Anomia</i>, the author has again been anticipated by Lacaze-Duthiers,
though he has already given, in another paper, most of
its anatomy and morphology: he would simply call attention to
its very long and curious crystalline stilette, unconnected with the
minute foot.</p>

<p>With respect to that <i>quæstio vexata</i>, the sexes of the Lamellibranchiata,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
he observes that any number of individuals of <i>Cyclas</i>
may be examined, and young fry will be found in the branchial
laminæ in all; that all Oysters have ova, and also all individuals of
<i>Pecten maximus</i>, the subpedal mass being visibly composed of an
ovary and a testis. He is obliged to believe that one species of
British <i>Anodon</i> is universally oviferous. But the common Edible
Cockle appears to have the individuals of different sexes, and the
same may be said with regard to <i>Mytilus edulis</i> and <i>Patella</i>.</p>

<p>The spermatozoa in the Cockle are oblong and a little curved,
and torulated, as it were, whilst they are pear-shaped in <i>Mytilus</i>;
they are also extremely minute, and their appendages must
be very fine, for with a power magnifying 500 diameters they are
scarcely to be seen.</p>

<p>In the shell of a <i>Patella</i>, <i>Emarginula</i>, or <i>Haliotis</i>, we have
the two conjoined valves of a lamellibranchiate mollusk; and
through such forms as <i>Calyptræa</i>, <i>Hipponyx</i>, <i>Navicella</i>, and <i>Nerita</i>,
we arrive at the ordinary form of the gasteropod with its
operculum.</p>

<p>Then follows a disquisition on the progressive tendency to a spiral
geometry in these animals, due to a varying plan of conformation,
and not to the force of the heart, there being generally an atrophy
of the left side of the body. In <i>Nautilus</i> and <i>Argonauta</i>, the shell
and mantle are reversed in position to what they are in the Gasteropods,
whilst <i>Sepia</i> and <i>Hyalæa</i> agree rather with the latter.
The symmetrical shell of the lower Gasteropods undergoes a
lateral torsion in the higher, spiral forms, to become again
symmetrical in the Cephalopoda. The branchiæ in <i>Patella</i> retain
a position analogous to that of the same organs in the Lamellibranchiata;
in some Chitons they have a tendency to retract
towards the anus, as in <i>Doris</i>; in <i>Fissurella</i> they waste at the
sides and become developed above the neck, as in the spiral
Gasteropods; but in them, the right branchia, and right side of
the mantle are principally developed. From this torsion arises
the form and spire of the shell. In <i>Aplysia</i>, where the branchial
fissure is far back and to the right side, the right respiratory
nerve preserves a superior position, and passes backwards to form
its ganglion at the front of the branchial opening; the left, on the
contrary, passes under the &oelig;sophagus to form a second ganglion,
not mentioned by Cuvier, behind the first. In the more spiral
Gasteropod the torsion is greater; the right nerve, for instance,
mounts upwards over the digestive canal to form its ganglion
quite in the left flank, whilst the left goes below the digestive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
canal to attain the right flank. In <i>Sepia</i> the branchiæ are again
symmetrical and abdominal.</p>

<p>The shell of the young <i>Sepia</i> is composed of distant plates, only
connected by minute transversely striated laminæ or flattened
tubes, producing by their insertion a beautiful appearance of
sinuous lines, very like those of a Baculite or Ammonite; and the
spongy part of the shell, so constituted, is probably filled with air
from the cavity of the body situated immediately in front, the
intervening membrane having a peculiar structure. This cavity of
the body exists in much lower mollusks; air being apparently
secreted in it, to lighten the animal.</p>

<p>The author thinks that, in considering the anatomy and form of
the body of the Gasteropoda, about ten species may be taken as
types of corresponding families.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Patella</span> <i>and its congeners</i>.&mdash;He claims to have been one of
the first to show the termination of the oviducts and renal organs
between the processes of the branchiæ in the Chitons. As they
are commonly phytivorous, the intestine is often very long and
disposed in large coils, in double apposition; the buccal apparatus is
very remarkable. <i>Chitonellus</i> differs but slightly from <i>Chiton</i>, the
central elements of its tongue, however, being little developed,
though having the same tessellated basement membrane. The
tongue of <i>Emarginula</i> differs much from that of <i>Patella</i>, having
an immense number of serrated side-hooks and a dilated middle
portion.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Calyptræa</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;The mollusks of this division have often
supranuchal branchiæ, as have some of the last; the sexes also
are frequently separate, rendering copulation necessary; and they
are sometimes partially spiral, with a tendency to form an operculum.
However, the little <i>Ancylus fluviatilis</i> appears to be what
is commonly called hermaphrodite, with a branchial lamina on
the left side, together with the heart and openings of the genital
organs; the stomach has a cæcum, and the penis a long filiform
appendage; the female parts opening near the rectum and behind
the male organs. It must respire by water rather than by air,
for, in a rapid stream, the stones at the bottom are covered with
<i>Ancyli</i> (upon which also its round oothecæ, each containing four
or five ova, are deposited), and it appears impossible for them to
get to the surface to breathe. On the contrary, the lake-<i>Ancylus</i>,
though the margin of its mantle is ciliated, may perhaps come to
the surface, ascending the stalks of the Water Persicaria, on
which it is mostly found, and on which its oothecæ are deposited.
When the dark cuticle of this last minute creature is removed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
its organs may be seen to be reversely disposed to those of the
larger species, the heart being placed to the right, before the apex
of the shell, and the rectum also on the same side.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Doris</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;The little <i>Doris aspera</i> swims, back downwards,
on the surface of a glass of sea-water, copulates, and deposits its
semicircular oothecæ. The brain of the common Lemon Doris is
of a fine orange colour, enveloped in a glandular matter, and is
constituted by a complicated assemblage of ganglia: there are
acoustic sacs and dark ocular spots upon it. There are six ganglia
on the buccal mass, and about six or eight minute ones on the
stomach. The anal sac appears to be a purple- or ink-bag; and
the so-called matrix is composed of a peculiar substance, swelling
enormously in water, of which it renders a large quantity viscid,
and being also coagulable by alcohol and bichloride of mercury,
but not by heat. Spermatozoa were found in the genital vesicle,
as well as in the epididymis and its cæcum. The spines of the
lingual plate are uniform, and in number about 10,000.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Aplysia</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;<i>Aplysia</i> has been before alluded to. Cuvier,
in his generally beautiful drawings, has scarcely done justice
to (5) <i>Ianthina</i>, nor to its beautiful float and ootheca; it is
peculiar for its fins, and the disk at the back of the foot. With
respect to <i>Magilus</i>, it should be removed from the (6) Tubulibranchiata,
its animal being a <i>Purpura</i> in structure, with a bent
horny operculum, and a very long linear appendage on the right
side of the head, leading to the supposition that the animals are
of different sexes, though there seem to be difficulties in the way
of sexual congress. In the specimen examined, the spire of the
shell was not solidified; the animal had a short proboscis, with
rather bent subulate feelers, and eyes on the outside; it had also
a rich purple secretion near the rectum on the right side.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Trochus</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;Some of the species of <i>Trochus</i> surpass even
<i>Emarginula</i> in the beauty of their lingual apparatus. The renal
organ opens into the bottom of the branchial cavity, contrary to its
disposition in <i>Helix</i> and <i>Lymnæus</i>, where its exit is near the respiratory
orifice. In <i>Planorbis</i>, that part of the respiratory cavity
receiving the excretions seems separated by an imperfect valve
from the right portion. With respect to the secretion of this organ,
it consists, in both Gasteropoda and Lamellibranchiata, of numerous
pellucid globular bodies, containing opaque earthy nuclei or
granules, and presenting different appearances in <i>Anodon</i> (for
instance), <i>Cyclostoma</i>, <i>Buccinum</i>, and <i>Helix</i>. When these bodies
are incinerated, lime is left, which in some cases appears to have
been combined with oxalic acid. The little <i>Nerita litoralis</i> presents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
the structure of the Turbonidæ very prettily and in small compass,
particularly in the very long spiral tongue. <i>Delphinula</i> has the
fringed mantle and sides and very wonderfully armed tongue of the
other Trochidæ. <i>Melania</i> is of similar organization to our well-known
<i>Paludina</i>, the stomach compound, the mantle and bilobed
head fringed, and the latter marbled like that of <i>Paludina</i>. <i>Ampullaria</i>
appears to be truly amphibious.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Buccinum</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;<i>Natica</i> presents much the same structure
as the common <i>Buccinum</i>, but has a muscular disk anterior to the
mouth,&mdash;a disposition, with some variations however, found in other
mollusks. The first and second stomachs are at a distance from
each other, the tongue is little developed, and the branchiæ (often
single in the Turbonidæ) two in number. <i>Purpura</i> also differs
but little from <i>Buccinum</i>. <i>Ovula</i> is a less attainable mollusk: the
foot is long and rather narrow, and subventral rather than subtrachelian,
with a sinuosity on the right of the neck, where also is
a short hooked penis in the male, receiving a vas deferens from
near the rectum behind; there is a large and small branchia, and
the reflected portion of the mantle is covered with tubercles and
tentacles,&mdash;no doubt a fine garnish in the living animal; the mouth
has a muzzle, and there are small eyes on the external sides of the
curved, awl-shaped tentacles; the elements of the tongue are
beautifully toothed and serrated.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">Lymnæus</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;Of the air-breathing aquatic and (10) terrestrial
gasteropods the most interesting particulars are their
generative organs, which the author proposes to re-examine. The
brain of <i>Helix aspersa</i> is composed internally of pyriform or
oval ganglionic vesicles, each giving origin to one or more nervous
fibres. The acoustic sacs are similar to those of <i>Doris</i>. The nerves
from the upper part of the ring are enveloped in a darkish neurilema,
and comprehend no doubt olfactory, optic, and tactile twigs;
there being the buccal ganglia for taste, and the acoustic sacs for
hearing; the twigs, however, forming the buccal or pharyngeal
ganglia have a broad double root on each side, near the origin of
the above three nerves. The lower part of the brain is very
analogous to that of <i>Sepia</i>, giving off nerves to the foot, and
external and internal respiratory ones to the mantle, respiratory
opening, branchiæ, &amp;c. <i>Lymnæus</i> has the cephalic ring formed by
about twelve ganglia, exclusive of two large and two minute ones
on the buccal mass. The upper portion of the ring has ganglionic
swellings, but in other respects the nerves are as in <i>Helix</i>.
Its lower portion consists of two pedal nerves, and has the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
acoustic spot and a minute ganglion upon it; behind, this lower
portion consists of five ganglia connected with both the anterior
and upper swellings by a cord, but separated from the former by the
aorta, as usual, and giving nerves to the flanks, pulmonary orifices
and sac, heart, stomach, and viscera. The lower ganglia are bright
yellow.</p>

<p>With respect to the Pteropoda, the branchiæ in <i>Hyalæa</i> exist
as a delicate membrane under the swollen part of the shell, in
structure much like the same part in the Ascidians, the inlet being
through the anterior opening of the mantle. There are eyes at the
fold of the mantle behind, and two small tentacles above the mouth;
the heart and rectum being on the left side, and the generative
opening at the base of the right ala. <i>Cleodora</i> is a very beautiful
creature, with the same disposition and structure of viscera;
brain-spots but no eyes were visible; the mantle had beautiful
muscular bands; the branchiæ as above; the buccal apparatus is
imperfect in both. <i>Cleodora</i> has similar membranous expansions
with <i>Hyalæa</i>, and also a sort of triangular lip.</p>

<p><i>Argonauta</i> has a lachrymal pore before and beneath the eye.
The beautiful and obvious respiratory mechanism in the Cephalopoda
needs not to be described. There is a large sac behind the
viscera of the Argonaut, which opens on each side; it is perhaps of
some hydrostatic use. There are at least three pairs of salivary
glands, of which four open on the floor of the mouth, and two or
three at the commencement of the gullet. Several small shells of
Pteropoda and fragments of Cephalopods were found in the stomach,
on which was observed the large nervous ganglion found in
all these, as well as in lower mollusks. The branchial nerves have
each two ganglia, of which the last at the root of the branchiæ is
rounder than the other; the branchial hearts have processes as
in <i>Sepia</i>. In <i>Sepia</i> two openings lead from the respiratory sac
into the cavity containing the venæ cavæ and their secreting appendages
often imbued with glittering crystalline particles, and
from the above cavities a wider opening on each side leads into a
second sac further back, situated in front of the shell. There are
auditory sacs in the Argonaut. The oviducts have separate openings,
but originate together. Both <i>Sepia</i> and <i>Argonauta</i> are infested
with a subcutaneous filiform entozoon, hooked anteriorly and rolled
up spirally in the former. <i>Loligo media</i> and <i>Sepiola</i> have but one
oviduct, and the two large, glandular, laminated organs, opening
at their summits, are wanting in <i>Argonauta</i> and <i>Octopus</i>. In
<i>Sepiola</i> one would almost think that copulation takes place, for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
author has taken what he supposes to be the capsules of Needham,
with dilated oval ends, tubular and bent pedicles or processes,
enclosed elastic filaments, and adhering zoosperms, from
the oviducts of the female: he has made the same observation
also in <i>Sepia</i>. The latter has very similar male organs to <i>Octopus</i>,
as described by Cuvier. In the embryo <i>Sepia</i>, the yelk
enters below the mouth and opens into the upper stomach, but
the beak of the animal also appears to be inserted into it behind.
The vitellus in reality therefore enters by the foot, as it
does in <i>Bulimus</i>, and probably in all Bivalves.</p>

<h2 id="ON_THE_LINNEAN_MANUSCRIPT_OF_THE_MUSEUM_ULRICAE" class="chapt">On the Linnean Manuscript of the 'Museum Ulricæ.' By <span class="smcap">Sylvanus Hanley</span>, Esq., F.L.S.</h2>

<p class="center">[Read Dec. 3, 1858.]</p>

<p>Not the least important result of the investigations of the Committee
appointed by the Linnean Society to examine the condition
of the collections and manuscripts of Linnæus, was the rediscovery
of a written copy of the 'Museum Ulricæ.' The volume
was manifestly, from internal evidence, a legible transcript of the
original manuscript of that work, with alterations and interpolations
in the peculiar handwriting of the author. It was, indubitably,
the unpublished catalogue so often mentioned in the tenth
edition of the 'Systema,' and contains descriptions of certain species
alluded to as defined, yet, strangely enough, omitted in the
printed edition. It is worthy of notice for many reasons: it corrects
the frequent misprints; explains the many fallacious allusions
to preceding species, their sequence being very different; it exhibits
those early synonyms, which, culled from comparison with
the actually described specimens, had been eventually supplanted
by supposed better representations; above all, it imparts to us
those original headings, or diagnoses (condensed from the subsequent
details), which had been suppressed, of old, in favour of
those already published in the 'Systema.'</p>

<p>This wholesale substitution, adopted by Linnæus, as a ready
method of avoiding a tedious revision of all the headings, when he
absorbed in the more comprehensive groups of his 'Systema' the
members of manuscript genera he had determined to reject, involved
a serious amount of confusion; for, oftentimes, the species of the
two works, although designated by the same appellations, were
totally distinct; and the combination of the diagnosis of the one
with the details of the other displayed an array of features not
known to be associated in any object in nature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>The generic arrangement exhibited in the manuscript differs
essentially from that which appeared in the final edition of his
'Systema Naturæ.' As a whole, it is decidedly inferior, yet it segregates
certain natural groups, such as <i>Lyra</i> and <i>Cassida</i>, the
value of which have been acknowledged by all modern naturalists.
The following list and sequence of the genera comprised in it, cannot,
indeed, be regarded as an entire system, for certain groups,
viz., <i>Chiton</i>, <i>Lepas</i>, <i>Teredo</i>, <i>Sabella</i>, and the typical forms of <i>Mya</i>,
<i>Mactra</i>, and <i>Anomia</i>, were not at that period represented in the
Museum; but it is not devoid of interest, since it manifests a transitional
stage in the progressive advance to that matured scheme
which was finally elaborated in the pages of his revised 'Systema.'</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Besides the four genera (<i>Chiton</i>, <i>Lepas</i>, <i>Teredo</i>, <i>Sabella</i>) that
were excluded from this catalogue, either from the absence of specimens,
or from mistrust of their being veritable Testacea, six of the
remaining 32, namely, <i>Pholas</i>, <i>Mya</i>, <i>Mactra</i>, <i>Chama</i>, <i>Anomia</i>, and
<i>Serpula</i>, were likewise omitted, not being yet eliminated from <i>Solen</i>,
<i>Bucardium</i>, <i>Spondylus</i>, <i>Ostrea</i>, and <i>Dentalium</i>. To counterbalance
these, we find no less than eight subsequently abandoned
groupings:</p>

<p><i>Turricula</i> (an undefined amalgam of the long-spired species
of <i>Buccinum</i>, <i>Murex</i>, and <i>Strombus</i>).</p>

<p><i>Lyra</i> (the <i>Harpa</i> and <i>Purpura</i> of the Lamarckian school).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p><i>Morion</i> (an unnatural compound of <i>Eburna</i>, <i>Auricula</i> proper,
<i>Pythia</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>).</p>

<p><i>Strombus</i> (a combination of the immature members of the received
genus with <i>Pyrula</i>, <i>Fasciolaria</i>, and other allied forms).</p>

<p><i>Cassida</i> (nearly the modern <i>Cassis</i>).</p>

<p><i>Pecten</i> (equal to <i>Lima</i> and <i>Pecten</i>).</p>

<p><i>Chama</i> (the <i>Tapes</i> of recent conchologists).</p>

<p><i>Pholas</i> (chiefly composed of <i>Artemis</i> and <i>Lucina</i>).</p>

<p>It may be remarked, moreover, that the simple univalves commence,
and the bivalves close the series; the exact converse of the
order in which they are marshalled in the two principal editions
of the 'Systema Naturæ.'</p>

<p>I feel assured, after a careful study of the manuscript, that the
names eventually allotted to the shells of the 'Museum' did not
result from a careful comparison of the royal specimens with the
typical examples in the private collection of our author, but were
attached to the species, either from the identity of the written and
printed synonymy, or from the general accordance of their described
features with the meagre characteristics enumerated in the prior
publication.</p>

<p>The erased nomenclature of the species, however, was very dissimilar,
and was scrupulously based upon a supposed identity of
the specimens with those delineated by Rumphius, Klein, and
d'Argenville. Assuredly at that period of his career, our author
entertained the same profound respect for the laws of priority
which is professed by all modern naturalists; and I hesitate not
to affirm that, from the crude and inharmonious theories of his
predecessors, he eliminated a system of Conchology that was
better suited to the requirements of the age he lived in than any
more elaborate arrangement would have been. For simplicity
attracts the student, whom a more complex (even if more natural)
method would repel; and for the collection of an adequate mass of
materials wherewith, eventually, to build up a more symmetrical
and widely-based structure, a multitude of comparatively unskilled
labourers is more efficacious than a small knot of the most erudite
architects.</p>

<p>Before inviting the attention of my readers to the original headings
of the 'Museum Ulricæ,' and to my brief account of the
variations in the written copy from the text of the printed version,
I must premise, that it has not been my practice invariably to
notice, in the summary, such trifling differences of construction as
the preferential use of the ablative for the nominative case, where
the verbal change involved no alteration of the precise meaning.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Museum Ludovicæ Ulricæ Reginæ.</span></p>

<p class="center">CONCHYLIA.</p>

<p class="center">CHITON, LEPAS.</p>

<p>Nothing relating to these two genera was found in the copy.</p>

<h3>PHOLAS.</h3>

<p>The <i>Pholas</i> of the manuscript is perfectly dissimilar to that of the
'Systema.' Our author had evidently, when he first wrote the 'Museum
Ulricæ,' not appreciated the remarkably striking characteristics of this
group, having located the only species he then knew (for <i>P. candidus</i> seems
a subsequent discovery) with the <i>Solens</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. candidus.</span> Not mentioned in the manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. crispatus.</span> <i>Sol.</i> ovatus, obtusissimus, cardinis dente depresso rotundato.</p>

<p>The Appendix to Lister was not cited; "Habitat in Anglia, Suecia," was
appended to the description, which in many respects was inferior to the
published one. The account of the hinge was merely "Cardo dente dilatato
rotundato extus excavato."</p>

<h3>MYA.</h3>

<p>The three incongruous forms assorted as <i>Myæ</i> were not so united in the
MS.; the second being very properly placed with the <i>Mussels</i>, the other
two ascribed to <i>Solen</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Lutraria.</span> <i>Sol.</i> ovali-oblongus, cardine laterali dilatato semiorbiculato.</p>

<p>In lieu of the reference to Lister (whose work does not appear to have
been consulted by our author at the period when this portion of his manuscript
was written), plate 45, figure N, of Rumphius was quoted as illustrative.
The published account of the hinge is much more complete than the
written one, which was apparently drawn up from a worn specimen; it
ran as follows: "Cardo extus vix gibbus, intus constans laminis 2 semiorbiculatis
concavis introrsum spectantibus."</p>

<p>By a slip of the pen, in my "Ipsa Linnæi Conchylia," I had termed
Brown's figure of the Linnean <i>Mya lutraria</i>, <i>L. oblonga</i>, instead of <i>L.
elliptica</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. perna.</span> <i>Myt.</i> lævis, cardine terminali unidentato.</p>

<p>The intended name was <i>M. Magellanicus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. vulsella.</span> <i>Sol.</i> oblongus, linguæformis, cardine terminali dilatato
semiorbiculato.</p>

<p>"Pinna linguaformis subfalcata" was written after the reference to the
'Museum Tessinianum;' hence it seems that Linnæus did not himself
consider that he had used the binomial method in that work, or he would
have quoted it as <i>P. lingulata</i>.</p>

<p>"Rumph. 148. t. 46. f.<span class="smcap">a</span>," and "Gualt. t. 90. f.<span class="smcap">h</span>," were the unpublished
synonyms.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<h3>SOLEN.</h3>

<p>Testa valvulis utrinque hiantibus. Cardo dente unico inflexo recurvo.</p>

<p>The <i>Mya lutraria</i>, <i>M. vulsella</i>, and <i>Pholas crispatus</i> were originally
included in this genus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. vagina.</span> <i>S.</i> linearis rectus, cardinibus unidentatis.</p>

<p>"Habitat in Indiæ littoribus arenosis: in mari Rubro (<i>Hasselquist</i>)" was
the recorded locality in the MS., where the European shell delineated by
Gualtieri was not then included: "Klein, 163. t. 11. f. 65" (a copy from
the cited figure of Rumphius) was its substitute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. siliqua.</span> <i>S.</i> linearis rectus, cardine altero bidentato.</p>

<p>The wretched drawings of Argenville were not quoted; but "Bonan. 2.
f. 56" (error for 57), "Plane. t. 3. f. 6," and "List. Ang. 192. t. 5. f. 37,"
were cited instead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. ensis.</span> <i>S.</i> linearis subarcuatus, cardine altero bidentato.</p>

<p>The final remark was not in the MS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. cultellus.</span> <i>S.</i> ovali-oblongus curvatus.</p>

<p>"Habitat in Amboinæ littoribus arenosis" is an addition of the MS.
The intended name (derived from Rumphius) was <i>cultriformis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. radiatus.</span> <i>S.</i> ovalis, cardinis costa tereti.</p>

<p>"Habitat in littoribus arenosis Xulii(?) Amboinæ" is an addition to the
published account. The intended specific name was <i>violaceus</i>, an appellation
bestowed upon it by Rumphius: "<i>solida</i>" was an emendation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. strigilatus.</span> <i>S.</i> ovalis, oblique striatus.</p>

<p>"Bonan. 2. f. 76" (error for 77) was an unpublished synonym.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. anatinus.</span> <i>S.</i> ovatus membranaceus, costa falcata.</p>

<p><i>Rostrum anatis</i> was the intended name.</p>

<h3>TELLINA.</h3>

<p>Testa altero latere inflexa. Cardo dentibus aliquot, raro lateralibus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. gargadia.</span> <i>T.</i> antice rugosa, rima dentata.</p>

<p>The absurd "marginis posticum latus remotum" was a misprint for
(dens) "marginis posticus, latus, remotus."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. lingua-felis.</span> <i>T.</i> subovata scabra.</p>

<p>"Klein, t. 11. f. 62" (cited in the 'Systema'), and "d'Arg. t. 25. f.G"
(the description of which suits better than the drawing) are the additions
of the MS.: "sesquilatiore" was the printed emendation of "latiore."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. virgata.</span> <i>T.</i> ovata, striis transversis retrorsum imbricatis, dentibus
lateralibus.</p>

<p>The erroneous reference to d'Argenville was not present: "Klein, 158.
Tellina virgata Rumphii" had been added by Linnæus. A very large portion
of the printed account is wanting in the MS., to wit&mdash;"æquales. Intus
radiis obsolete incarnatis picta." "Labris rugosis et scabris," "hymene
tectis. Anus est rima concava," "primores," "transversi cum cavitate pro
oppositis dentibus," "longitudinalem." The "retrorsum" was originally
"sursum"; "dextrum" was "sinistram"; "Tertius dens" was "Altera
testa."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. gari.</span> <i>T.</i> ovalis, striis transversis retrorsum imbricatis, dentibus
lateralibus nullis.</p>

<p>The G in the reference to Rumphius, and the F in the reference to
d'Argenville were misprints for D and I, and were so published in the
'Systema:' the "primoribus" was an emendation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. albida.</span> <i>T.</i> ovalis, lævis, nymphis prominulis. "Primores" was
an emendation. The species was unnamed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. foliacea</span>. <i>T.</i> antice scabra, rima serrata.</p>

<p>The Rumphian name "folium" was the intended appellation: "Klein,
162. t. 11. f. 64" was cited, as in the 'Systema': "aciatum" was the
reading for the printed "acutum."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. planata.</span> <i>T.</i> ovata plana, transversim striata, marginibus acutis.</p>

<p>The erroneous reference to Gualtieri (whose figure C looks more like the
species than his G) is not to be found in the manuscript. The species was
not named.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. lævigata.</span> <i>T.</i> ovata lævis, nymphis intractis.</p>

<p>The figure of <i>T. chloroleuca</i> in Rumphius was not quoted, neither was
the hence-derived appellation attached: the "radiato" and "primoribus"
were also subsequent additions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. radiata.</span> <i>T.</i> ovali-oblonga, longitudinaliter substriata, sutura postica
canaliculata. "Obsoletis" and "primores" were subsequent emendations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. rostrata.</span> <i>T.</i> oblonga, antice angulato-rostrata.</p>

<p>The <i>T. rostrata</i> of the final edition of the 'Systema' was assuredly the
<i>T. Spengleri</i>, and with that shell solely will the printed account in the
'Museum Ulricæ' accord. But the five earlier lines of the description
(save "et albus"), and the detailed dentition (except "fossula distinctus"),
with the varieties <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>g</i>, and the same synonyms as in the tenth edition of
the 'Systema,' appear in the MS. with the name <i>T. petasunculus</i> attached.
Whether designedly or not, there was a pictorial definition of <i>T. vulsella</i>
in the earlier 'Systema;' and if an author be not allowed to amend his
description, <i>T. vulsella</i> is better entitled than <i>T. Spengleri</i> to the name
<i>rostrata</i>. "Margo exterior parum repandum est" was written in the MS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. remies.</span> <i>T.</i> rugosa, suborbiculata.</p>

<p>The expressions "hians," "primores," "remoti," and the last five words
of the details were absent; "utrinque" followed "duo": "non" in place
of "vix" was the earlier reading.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. scobinata.</span> <i>T.</i> scabra orbiculata.</p>

<p>"Primores," and "in altera testa profunda fossula distinctus," were not
in the copy.</p>

<h3>CARDIUM.</h3>

<p>Cardo dentibus baseos binis, marginis solitariis remotis acutis. Valvulæ
gibbæ, hinc figura cordis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bucardium</span> was the epithet applied in the written copy to the members
of this genus, to which the <i>Solen bullatus</i> of the 'Systema' was correctly
referred. <i>Mactra</i> had not then been separated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. costatum.</span> <i>Buc.</i> sulcis costis elevatis membranaceis.</p>

<p>The original description has been somewhat enlarged in the press, by the
addition of "brevissimis," "et extrorsum flexis," "fossula distinctus; at
vero ille sub anno quasi duplex"; "minus vero ad latera sulcata," moreover,
was simply "ad alterum latus": the only expression omitted in printing
was "reflexus," which followed "Anus margine."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Cardissa.</span> <i>Buc.</i> compressum, valvis carinatis, natibus contiguis.</p>

<p>"Colum. Aqu. 19. t. 16" (cited also in the 'Systema') was quoted in
the MS. from which the "vix," "subcontigui," "remotus, validus, fossula
distinctus," were absent. The "Rima" was termed "subrotunda" instead
of "cordata."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. hemicardium.</span> <i>Buc.</i> subquadrilaterum: valvulis carinatis, umbonibus
distantibus.</p>

<p>"Fasciis" was a misprint for the original "facies": "sulcis convexis"
was written "sulcis excavato-rugosis." There was no specific appellation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. medium.</span> <i>Buc.</i> subcordatum subangulatum; valvulis angulatis sulcatis
lævibus.</p>

<p>The prefatory remarks were the only portion of the printed description
to be found in the MS. The species was not named, but was quoted in
the 'Systema' before the publication of its details.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. aculeatum</span> (misprinted "muricatum"). <i>Buc.</i> subcordatum, sulcis
convexis, linea cava exaratis, versus apicem dentatis.</p>

<p>The intended name was <i>verum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. echinatum.</span> <i>Buc.</i> subcordatum, sulcis acutis exaratis linea elevata
ciliata aculeis inflexis plurimis.</p>

<p>"List. Ang. 188. t. 5. f. 33, Pectunculus echinatus," "Bonan. 2. t. 90,"
"Gesu. Aq. 131, 132," "Faun. Suec. 1339," "Rondel. Aq. 22," were the
original synonyms, to which our author had subsequently added "Klein,
139. t. 10. f. 40." "Alba" followed "gibba"; "parum antrorsum inflexis"
was the reading for the printed "erectis subulatis"; "extrorsum"
for the "uti extus": "brevioribus. Anus lævis, sutura simplici prominula,"
"recurvi," "fossula distinctus," were emendations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. tuberculatum.</span> <i>Buc.</i> subcordatum, sulcis obtusis nodosis transversim
striatis.</p>

<p>"Gualt. t. 71. f. <span class="smcap">m</span>." was a correct additional synonym.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. isocardia.</span> <i>Buc.</i> cordatum, sulcis imbricatis squamis fornicatis.</p>

<p>"Klein, 138. isocardia fragum" had been interpolated by Linnæus;
hence the name, which was not in the original. The "fossula distincti"
has replaced the earlier "validi."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. fragum.</span> <i>Buc.</i> subcordatum subangulatum, sulcis notatis semicirculis
elevatis.</p>

<p>By the addition of "mala" to the erroneously cited figure of Gualtieri,
our author has virtually repudiated it. "Spinosæ" followed "Pruni;" the
fallacious "s. rubris" was not present, nor "sæpe" either; "anteriore"
stood in the place of "postico," and "postico" in that of "antico." The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
descriptions of the "rima" and "anus" have been added: "recurvati"
and "fossula distincti" were amplifications.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Unedo.</span> <i>Buc.</i> subcordatum, sulcis lunulis coloratis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. muricatum.</span> <i>Buc.</i> subrotundum sulcatum, lateribus muricatis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. magnum.</span> <i>Buc.</i> oblongum, sulcis angulatis latere serratis.</p>

<p>I had hoped to have found the 19 a misprint, but the MS. and the
printed copy agree precisely in every particular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. flavum.</span> <i>Buc.</i> subovatum sulcatum, latere altero scabrum, altero
dentatum.</p>

<p>The redundant "subovata" was not in the copy, where the remark was
made that the species resembled the shell subsequently termed <i>Chama cor</i>,
the figure of which (Gualt. t. 71. f. E.) had been cited, but erased in the
MS. The ideal hence derived is a very different shell from the one supposed
identical. No mention is made of lateral teeth: was it then a veritable
<i>Cardium</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. lævigatum.</span> <i>Buc.</i> ovatum, striis læviusculis longitudinalibus.</p>

<p>I do not consider this (the <i>B. striatum</i> of the MS.) to be identical with
the <i>C. lævigatum</i> of the 'Systema.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. serratum.</span> <i>Buc.</i> ovale læve, antice serratum.</p>

<p>"Ovata" stood in the place of the printed "obovata": "curvatus"
and "parvi" were subsequent to the MS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. triste.</span> <i>Buc.</i> ovatum læve, rima anoque obsolete striatis.</p>

<p>The 'Museum' was referred to for this shell previously to the publication
of the details. Curious to relate, the species was wholly omitted in the
twelfth edition of the 'Systema.' It was, in all probability, a <i>Mactra</i>,
which genus had not been constituted at the period when the description
of <i>C. triste</i> was issued.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. pectinatum.</span> <i>Buc.</i> subcordatum, striis hinc longitudinalibus, illine
transversalibus.</p>

<p>The erroneous reference to Gualtieri was not present in the written copy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mention was made in the 'Systema' of a <i>Solen bullatus</i>, for a more
detailed account of which the reader was referred to the 'Museum Ulricæ.'
No such species appeared in the published edition; but the omitted shell
(a veritable <i>Cardium</i>) was thus described in the unprinted version:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buc. bullatum.</span> <i>B.</i> subrotundum, antice crenato-hians.</p>

<p>Rump. 143. t. 44. f. N. Pecten bullatus.</p>

<p>Testa subrotunda, inflata, gibba, fragilis, pellucida, substriata, rufo nebulosa,
antice hians, margine serrato. Umbones tumidi, obtusi, reflexi.
Rima minima brevissima. Ani regio obsoleta. Dens cardinis fere unicus,
minimus. Marginales solitarii, remoti, compressi, majores.</p>

<h3>DONAX.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Trunculus</span> was the proposed name of this genus, which was thus
characterized:&mdash;</p>

<p>Testa compressa, antice obtusissima, retusa. Cardinis dentibus 2, marginis
unicus.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. scortum</span> was wisely omitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. pubescens.</span> <i>Trun.</i> antice spinis ciliatus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. rugosa.</span> <i>Trun.</i> antice rugosus, marginibus crenatis.</p>

<p>The printed "cuneiformis" has replaced the earlier "majuscula"; and
"crenulatis" was originally "undulatis." "Intus subviolacea est" was
not in the written copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. trunculus.</span> <i>Trun.</i> antice lævis, marginibus crenatis.</p>

<p>The reference to Klein was not in the original, but "d'Arg. t. 25. f. L."
was quoted (as in the twelfth edition of the 'Systema'). The last seven
words printed were not in the copy. The intended name was <i>gibbus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. CUNEATA.</span> <i>Trun.</i>  cuneiformis, marginibus integerrimis.</p>

<p>The final remark was not in the copy, where "parva, ovata," preceded
"cuneiformis." The then unpublished details were quoted in the
'Systema.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. scripta.</span> <i>Trun.</i> ovatus lævis scriptus.</p>

<p>The erroneous citation of Gualtieri (a misprint for 88. f. Q.) was not in
the copy, and, as the figure represents the <i>D. trunculus</i> in the page opposite,
I suspect was carelessly placed here by the printer, when our author had
inserted it in his revised proof. I suspect this error often occurred, as for
instance in <i>Tellina planata</i> and <i>radiata</i>, where Gualtieri's figure (added
during revision) was attached to the former instead of to the latter.
"Margo interne crenulatus," and nearly the entire account of the teeth,
were emendations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. muricata.</span> <i>Trun.</i> ovatus, striis muricatis, margine denticulato.</p>

<p>"Postice solitarii" followed the final "utrinque": "primores" was
an emendation.</p>

<h3>VENUS.</h3>

<p>This genus (as a whole) was not to be found in the manuscript System.
Its components were distributed into three groups, two of which bore
names that were subsequently allotted to forms very remote from those
therein so designated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cunnus.</span> Testa subrotunda. Rima nymphis instructa. Dentes cardinis
4, lateralibus divaricatis versus latera. This contained the bulk of
the <i>Veneres</i>, all except Nos. 63, 66, and those referred to <i>Pholas</i> and
<i>Chama</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pholas.</span> Testa lenticularis. Rima fissa, destituta nymphis. Dentes
cardinis 1 s. 2, marginalis tantum intra anum. <i>V. Pennsylvanica</i>, <i>incrustata</i>,
<i>punctata</i>, <i>edentula</i>, <i>exoleta</i>, <i>scripta</i>, <i>pectinata</i>, <i>ziczac</i> were its constituents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chama.</span> Testa ovalis cum angulo. Cardo dentibus 4 confertis, quorum
unus in singula valvula bifidus. In this were located <i>V. literata,
rotundata, decussata</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Dione.</span> <i>Cun.</i> cordatus, antice pubescenti-spinosus.</p>

<p>The same references to Petiver, Olearius, and Lister were present as in
the 'Systema.' The final remark was an addition. The proposed name
was <i>C. Veneris</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. marica.</span> <i>Cun.</i> subcordatus, decussatim striatus, pube lamellosa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Dysera.</span> <i>Cun.</i> testa subcordata, sulcis transversis reflexis, labiis
concavis incumbentibus.</p>

<p>Neither "Huic rugæ, &amp;c.," "lævis," nor the synonym of Lister were in
the original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Chione.</span> <i>Cun.</i> subovatus, lævis.</p>

<p>The erroneous reference to d'Argenville was not inserted in the MS.,
from which "lanceolatis," likewise, was absent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. maculata.</span> <i>Cun.</i> testa ovato-cordata lævis.</p>

<p>"Lanceolata" and "ovato-oblongus" have been additions. The observation
that it was difficult to distinguish this shell (which was not
named in the MS.) from the following, would mislead one, since the
remark referred to two unpublished species, which it originally preceded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. meretrix.</span> <i>Cun.</i> subcordatus glaber, labris gibbis, nymphis apice
hiantibus.</p>

<p><i>C. vulgatus</i> was the name originally designed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. castrensis.</span> Cun. suborbiculatus glaber, characteribus scriptus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Meroe.</span> <i>Cun.</i> sutura postica hians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Fimbriata.</span> <i>Cun.</i> subrotundus decussatus rugosus, longitudinaliter
striatus.</p>

<p>D'Argenville was not referred to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. reticulata.</span> <i>Cun.</i> subcordatus, striis crenatis decussatis, ano
cordato.</p>

<p>V. tigerina. Cun. suborbiculatus, striis crenatis decussatis, ano
ovato.</p>

<p>The name was an error, having been derived from the "Lingua tigerina"
of Rumphius (his figure G., not H.): <i>fuliginosus</i> was the one originally
intended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. prostrata.</span> <i>Pho.</i> orbiculata, transverse striata, labiis scabro-membranaceis.</p>

<p>The unpublished details had been previously referred to in the 'Systema.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Pennsylvanica.</span> <i>Pho.</i> glabra, rugosa, antice sulco longitudinali.</p>

<p>"Habitat in Pennsylvania," and "subdiaphana," were the unprinted
additions. The "margo interne crenatus," "nates sub-recurvatæ," and
"color intus versus marginem violaceus," were not in the copy. The last
character (so utterly inappropriate to the features of <i>Lucina P.</i>) was, I
suspect, intended for <i>punctata</i> on the page opposite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. incrustata.</span> <i>Pho.</i> glaberrima lævissima, punctis excavata.</p>

<p>The details were referred to in the 'Systema' before their publication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. punctata.</span> <i>Pho.</i> longitudinaliter sulcata.</p>

<p>The G in the reference to Rumphius was a misprint for the written D,
from which figure ("Chama pectinata") our author had proposed to
borrow the specific name, but subsequently had preferred the published
designation. "Klein, 147. Actinobolos æquilatera" has been added to
the MS. by Linnæus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. exoleta.</span> <i>Pho.</i> decussatim striata.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>The original synonymy and details have been so transmuted in the press,
that it is manifest that the amended (!) species was perfectly distinct from
the shell originally designed. The name of the latter was <i>clathrata</i>, and
the declared sculpture was not merely "transversim," but "et longitudinaliter"
likewise (in place of "striis retrorsis"). The reference (added
by Linnæus) was not to Gualtieri, but to Lister, 335, f. 172, and its copy
in Klein (t. 10. f. 52), both which would have more appropriately been
assigned to <i>V. reticulata</i>. The <i>V. exoleta</i> having been previously defined
in the 'Systema,' this confusion becomes of little importance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. ziczac.</span> <i>Pho.</i> striis transversis membranaceis erectis.</p>

<p>The number which indicates the position of this species in the 'Museum'
has been subsequently ('Syst.' ed. 12) referred to <i>V. cancellata</i>, yet,
judging from the generic appellation (and consequent dentition), it could
scarcely have been that well-known species. The "lentiformi" of the
'Systema' (ed. 10), where the name <i>ziczac</i> first appeared, forbids the
annexation; but, although the details of the 'Museum' were there referred
to, the obnoxious word was not mentioned in that publication. The
following are the printed emendations (?): "lævis, et quasi excisa," "compressa,"
"variat colore albissimo."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. pectinata.</span> <i>Pho.</i> sulcis longitudinalibus nodosis, antice antrorsum
ramosa.</p>

<p>The additional synonym of "Gualt, D. 75, f. A." appears in the MS.,
where "quam reliquæ" follows "orbiculata," and in place of "In area
antica" may be read "et a primo sulco." The details there terminate
with the word "lanceolatum," "<i>Ramosa</i>" was the intended name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. scripta.</span> <i>Pho.</i> striata, postice angulo recto circumscripta.</p>

<p>The incorrect figure of d'Argenville was not indicated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. edentula.</span> <i>Pho.</i> subgloboso-lenticulata rugosa edentula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. literata.</span> <i>Cha.</i> transversim striato-ovata.</p>

<p>The earlier reading of confertim was "profunde"; "striis crenulatis
antice et postice," "lanceolata," and "tres s." were absent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. rotundata.</span> <i>Cha.</i> transversim striata ovata absque angulo.</p>

<p>The printed additions are "varius in variis," "aut albis," "lanceolata,"
and the final remark. There was no name attached in the MS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. decussata.</span> <i>Cha.</i> testa ovata, decussatim striata.</p>

<p>"Sæpe" and "minimus" are the sole printed additions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Probably the <i>V. Phryne</i> of the 'Systema' was designed by the following
unpublished description:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cun. venosus.</span> C. subcordatus lævis lateribus rugosis. Testa cinerea,
nuce coryli major, gibba, glabra, antice et postice transversim sulcata.
Margo exterius tantum denticulatus, non vero apex externus, aut margines
laterales.</p>

<p>The <i>V. macrodon</i> answers fairly enough to this definition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<h3>SPONDYLUS.</h3>

<p>This very natural genus was confused with <i>Chama</i>, and thus characterized:&mdash;</p>

<p>Testa imbricata. Cardo e callo gibbo oblique inserto fossula obliqua.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">S. Gæderopus.</span> <i>S.</i> imbricatus auritus, cardine dentato.</p>

<p>"Rumph. t. 48. f. 1," "Gualt. t. 99. f. E. F. G," "Bonan. 2. f. 21,"
"Rondel. c. 40. p. 41," were the additional synonyms of the MS. The
"ad cardinem truncata" was an emendation for the previous "breviore":
the "superiore" a misprint for the written "inferiore": the final remark
was not present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. Regius.</span> <i>S.</i> spinosus sulcatus inauritus cardine dentato.</p>

<p>No name was attached to this species: the previous one had been termed
<i>Pectinites</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. plicatus.</span> Not mentioned in the manuscript.</p>

<h3>CHAMA.</h3>

<p>The members of this genus were included in <i>Spondylus</i>, except <i>cordiformis</i>,
which was referred to <span class="smcap">Bucardium</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. gigas.</span> <i>Sp.</i> plicatus squamosus, ano hiante crenato.</p>

<p>The species as originally defined was more comprehensive in its details
than when printed; for the restricting "decussatim" had not been added,
and "Gualt. t. 93. f. B." was an additional synonym. The printed
additions were "obsoletis," "Margine reflexo," "exteriore duplicato longiore,"
and the final remark. <i>S. imbricatus</i> was the intended name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. hippopus.</span> <i>Sp.</i> plicatus muricatus, ano retuso clauso dentato.</p>

<p>"Arg. t. 26. f. H." was an additional synonym of the MS.: the printed
20 should have been 10, as written: "ut in præcedente" was an emendation:
<i>S. asper</i> was the proposed name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Lazarus.</span> <i>Sp.</i> imbricatus.</p>

<p>Seba was not cited: "obliquam" followed "fossam" in the MS.
"Elevatis," "longitudine testæ," "productiore," "instar auris" formed
no portion of the early description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. antiquata.</span> <i>Sp.</i> subcordatus, sulcis perpendicularibus transversim
striatis.</p>

<p>No name was attached to the original details, which appear to have been
altered ("in aliis minimum cordatum impressum fuscum"), and the
synonym of Bonanni added, in order to comprise that species (<i>Cardita sulcata</i>)
which had been pictorially defined in the 'Systema.' "Gibba" was
preceded by "admodum": "obsoletis" was not present. <i>Cardita bicolor,
var. unicolor</i> was probably intended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. semiorbiculata.</span> <i>Sp.</i> semiorbiculatus compressus, decussate striatus,
rudis.</p>

<p>"Interior" was the earlier reading of "primarius."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. cordata.</span> <i>Sp.</i> cordatus, transversim striatus, hinc elongatus, compressus.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. oblonga.</span> <i>Sp.</i> oblongus, antice angulatus, dentibus anticis acutis.</p>

<p>"Unico" (error for "unicus") originally preceded "in altera valvula."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. cordiformis.</span> <i>Buc.</i> subrotundum læve, umbonibus recurvatis.</p>

<p>The brief description in the 'Systema' had evidently been copied in the
manuscript by our author himself, who cited Gualt. t. 71. f. E. as the sole
synonym. The specimen had apparently been added to the collection,
subsequently to the drawing up of the first catalogue.</p>

<h3>ARCA.</h3>

<p>Testa crassa, umbonibus distantibus intus fornicatis. Cardo planus,
masticatus dentibus numerosis minimis æqualibus transversis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. tortuosa.</span> <i>A.</i> oblonga obliqua, valvula altera oblique carinata.</p>

<p>"Nates, &amp;c." and "Cardo, &amp;c." were the printed additions to the earlier
description. The 'Systema' synonyms of Klein (t. 8. f. 16) and Bonanni
(2. f. 128) were present in the manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. Noæ.</span> <i>A.</i> oblonga angulata hians.</p>

<p>This manuscript furnishes us with the additional synonyms of</p>

<p>"Aldrov. 3. p. 513." and "Sloan. Hist. 2. p. 257. Musculus Matthioli,"
besides the previously published references to Lister (368. n. 208) and
Bonanni (2. t. 32). The formation of the hinge was not, however, indicated,
and the passage commencing with "Nates" has been enlarged from "Umbones
remotissimæ, area interjecta concava, ad angulum rectum striata.
Margo exterior in medio hians, apertura barbata."</p>

<p>The intended specific epithet was <i>A. Noemi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. antiquata.</span> <i>A.</i> testa oblique cordata, transversim sulcata, antice
angulo compresso, rima intra rhombum transversim striata.</p>

<p>The admixture of two species (at the least) in the published edition
resulted from the amalgamation of two earlier descriptions. To the above
diagnosis belonged the printed details with the following important changes.
In place of "extus striata longitudinaliter sulcis crenatis," the reading was
simply "intus striata longitudinaliter," and in lieu of "interjecto spatio
rhombeo plano," merely "rima patens."</p>

<p>The proposed name for this shell, from a supposition of its identity with
the <i>Pecten virgineus</i> of Rumphius, was <i>A. virginea</i>. The other species
which Linnæus referred to the same numerals of the 'Systema' was not
named, but was thus characterized:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. (Sys. n. 144). <i>A.</i> cordata, sulcis nodosis, rima decussatim striata.</p>

<p>List. Hist. ... Pecten polyleptoginglymus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Gualt. t. 87. f. C.</p>

<p>Testa reliquis magis gibba, albido-flavescens, sulcis xxx obtusis, transversim
nodosis: nodis transversis, obtusissimis, imbricatis. Intus albida.
Margo dentibus xxx argutiusculis. Rima sulco rhombeo circumscripta,
disco decussatim vix manifeste striato. Umbones distantes ad neutrum
latus flexi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. senilis.</span> <i>A.</i> oblique cordata, octosulcata, lævis, antice hians, rima
obtusangule striata.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>Lister (without numerals!) was referred to in illustration; the early
unimproved account of the beaks and ligamental area ran as follows:
"Umbones distantes, oblique incurvati. Rima hians striata transversim
ad angulos acutos": "et profunde immersis" was an addition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. granosa.</span> <i>A.</i> subcordata, sulcis muricatis, rima obtusangule striata,
utrinque angulum formante.</p>

<p>The name was evidently borrowed from Rumphius, whose <i>Pecten granosus</i>
("143. t. 44. f. K.") was referred to in the manuscript, though neither
quoted in the printed copy nor in the 'Systema' (ed. x.). "Bonan. 2.
n. 73," and Lister (without numerals) were also cited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. decussata.</span> <i>A.</i> lenticularis, decussatim substriata, apicibus reflexis.</p>

<p>For a detailed account of this shell, to which no specific name was
attached in the MS., the 'Museum Ulricæ' was referred to, previous to its
publication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. pallens.</span> <i>A.</i> lenticulari-subobliqua, decussatim striata, rima brevi.</p>

<p>This was the type referred to in the 'Systema.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. pectunculus.</span> <i>A.</i> lenticularis sulcata, decussatim rugosa.</p>

<p>"Arg. t. 27. f. B," and Lister without numerals appended, were the
unpublished synonyms. The expressions "leviter," "exteriore tenui;
sulcata," "in arcum," were not parts of the original copy, which contained,
however, the unprinted paragraph "latere interiore margine prominente
notato." There was no specific name attached to either this or
the next species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. glycimeris.</span> <i>A.</i> lentiformis, transversim substriata, rima lævi.</p>

<p>The '<i>Chama glycimeris Bellonii</i>' of Lister (t. 247) was an unprinted
synonym.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following suppressed description of an unnamed Ark that was allied
to, if it were not, <i>fusca</i> or <i>barbata</i>, was found in the manuscript. The
'Museum' had been referred to in the synonymy of the latter in the 'Systema,'
but the species was not mentioned in the published version.</p>

<p><i>Arca</i> ovalis, compressiuscula, apicibus subcontiguis.</p>

<p>Testa rudis, ferrugineo-fusca, longitudinaliter striata, striis quasi ex
punctis callosis concatenatis, alternis striis majoribus ovatis, parum obliqua,
minus lateribus gibba, rotunda absque angulis. Margo æqualis, edentulus.
Apices recurvi fere tangunt se invicem. Rima dentibus minutissimis, antice
longius extensa, nec recta.</p>

<h3>OSTREA.</h3>

<p>The very natural genus <i>Pecten</i> was separated from the unsymmetrical
oysters, with the following definition:&mdash;</p>

<p>PECTEN. Testa subrotunda, altera planior, basis transversa, anguli
transversi (auriculæ) ad basin. Cardo cavitas conica, striis utrinque 3 longitudinalibus
obliquis.</p>

<p>The genus OSTREUM, enlarged by the addition of the true oysters
confounded with the <i>Mytili</i>, the <i>Meleagrinæ</i>, <i>Aviculæ</i>, and the <i>Anomia
placenta</i>, was thus characterized:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. maxima.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 14 rotundatis longitudinaliter striatis.</p>

<p>In place of Gualtieri, "List. Ang. 184. t. 5. f. 29. Pecten maximus,"
and "Faun. Suec. 1343" were referred to: these synonyms had been
added subsequently to the description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. Jacobæa.</span>  <i>Pec.</i> radiis 14 angulatis, fornicis longitudinaliter striatis.</p>

<p>The cited drawing of Gualtieri was not mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. ziczac.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 18 explanatis.</p>

<p>No specific name was attached to this, the preceding, and the next two
species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. striatula.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 16 obliteratis, transverse membranaceostriatis,
margine integerrimo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. minuta.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 20 convexis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. pleuronectes.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 12 duplicatis, extus lævis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. obliterata.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 24 duplicatis, extus lævis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. radula.</span>  <i>Pec.</i> radiis 6 convexis decussate striatis, margine crenato,
auriculis æqualibus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. plica.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 16 convexis læviusculis, decussato-striatus.</p>

<p>No specific name was appended to either this, the next, or the two
preceding species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. pallium.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 12 convexis, striatus, scaber, squamis imbricatus.</p>

<p>This with the remainder of the <i>Pectens</i> (as far as <i>flavicans</i>) formed a
group characterized by "Auricula altera intus ciliato-spinosa."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. nodosa.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 9 nodoso-vesicularibus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. pes-felis.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 9, lævis, fornice squamis fornicatis.</p>

<p>The printed diagnosis, or heading, was evidently drawn up from a different
shell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. pellucens.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 9, lævis, fornice squamis cochleari-hemisphæricis.</p>

<p>No name was attached to this or the next shell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. sanguinea.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 22 scabris, semiauritus.</p>

<p>The reference was not to plate 74 (as printed) of Gualtieri, but to plate
73. "Purpureus nigro undatus" was written after the indicated colouring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. varia.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 30 scabris explanatis.</p>

<p>"Et omnia cadem" followed "sanguineæ"; "striis compressis echinatis"
was not present; "color pallidior" was in the place of "concolor."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. pusio.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 40 filiformibus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. glabra.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 10 lævibus planiusculis, internis striis elevatis
duplicatis.</p>

<p>Gualtieri's rude drawing was not quoted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. opercularis.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 20 subrotundis, decussate striato-scaber,
operculo convexiore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. gibba.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 20 glabris, gibbus.</p>

<p>Brown's drawing was not quoted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. flavicans.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 8 striatis, margine altero rotundato.</p>

<p>As in the 'Systema,' the next two shells, along with this, formed a group
distinguished as having the "Valvulis altero latere magis gibbis." No
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
names had been appended to this, the three preceding, and the two following
species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. fasciata.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 20, auriculis æqualibus exoletis.</p>

<p>The "gibba" of the borrowed diagnosis was not, it may be observed, in
the original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. lima.</span> <i>Pec.</i> radiis 22, imbricatis squamis, altero margine rotundato,
auriculis obliteratis.</p>

<p>The "gibba" of the borrowed heading was not in the original diagnosis.
The final remark was likewise absent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. isognomon.</span> The entire account of this species was added to the
copy in the Linnean handwriting. "Klein, 128. t. 8. f. 15. Isognomon"
and "Cardo ut ephippo" had been omitted in printing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. malleus.</span> <i>O.</i> trilobum.</p>

<p>"Transverso ad marginem" was a subsequent addition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. folium.</span> <i>O.</i> ovatum, lateribus obtuse plicatum.</p>

<p>Klein's copy (t. 8. f. 22.) of the indicated figure in Rumphius was cited,
in the handwriting of Linnæus: the "cavitate conica" was an emendation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. edule.</span> <i>O.</i> subrotundum semiorbiculatum, valvula altera plana
integerrima.</p>

<p>There was no semicolon after "opaca," but a comma after "latiore."
The original sole synonym was the omitted one of "Gualt t. 102. f. B."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. semiauritum.</span> <i>O.</i> semiauritum ovatum læve, basi obliqua.</p>

<p>Linnæus himself had added this species to the earlier catalogue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. ephippium.</span> <i>O.</i> submembranaceum curvum, cardine octosulcato.</p>

<p>In addition to the published <i>Ostreæ</i>, the following description of the
shell subsequently termed <i>O. perna</i> (Syst. ed. 12.) was found in the
manuscript:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>O.</i> rugosum, inæquale, tumidiusculum, cardine octocrenato.</p>

<p>Testa perniformis, obovata, substantia ligni antiqui, tumidiuscula, superficie
obsolete rugosa, inæquali interne livida. Cardo transversus, margine
inflexo, notatus crenis obtusis circiter 8.</p>

<h3>ANOMIA.</h3>

<p>The single species here mentioned was comprehended in <i>Ostreum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. placenta.</span> <i>O.</i> orbiculatum planum pellucidum.</p>

<p>Reference was made, by a long periphrasis, to plates 225, 226 of Lister's
'Historiæ'; Seba was not quoted: "intra discum testæ adnatis" was
absent.</p>

<h3>MYTILUS.</h3>

<p>Testa opaca, læviuscula. Cardo nullis dentibus instructus, sed fossula
obliqua intra marginem.</p>

<p>This definition very properly excluded the oysters which had been erroneously
inserted in this genus. Only the <i>Mytili</i> and <i>Modiolæ</i> of Lamarck
were left as members; for <i>margaritiferus</i> and <i>hirundo</i> were transferred to
<i>Ostreum</i>!!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. frons.</span> <i>Ost.</i> acutum plicatum, labio altero scabro.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. crista-galli.</span> <i>Ost.</i> acutum, plicatum, labio utroque scabro.</p>

<p>The reading of the MS. was not "secundum marginem insculptus," but
"secundum marginem Mytilus."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. hyotis.</span> <i>Ost.</i> subacuto-plicatum imbricatum squamis compressis,
labio utrinque glabro.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. margaritiferus.</span> <i>Ost.</i> semiauritum, imbricatum tunicis, basi
transversum.</p>

<p>"Bonan. 2. f. 1." was the omitted synonym. The description of the
hinge was not at first inserted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. unguis.</span> <i>M.</i> subrotundus, longitudinaliter striatus, pellucidus.</p>

<p>This ambiguous species was not named, but placed next to <i>Ostrea edulis</i>.
I entertain but little doubt of its being a young <i>Perna</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. lithophagus.</span> <i>M.</i> cylindricus.</p>

<p>Neither Gualtieri nor d'Argenville was referred to, which confirms my
idea that the species of the 'Museum' (termed <i>coriaceus</i> in the manuscript)
was not the Mediterranean <i>Lithodomus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. bilocularis.</span> <i>M.</i> striatus, cardine fornicato.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. exustus.</span> <i>M.</i> striatus, dorso angulato.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. edulis.</span> <i>M.</i> lævis, subcurvatus, cardine terminali mutico.</p>

<p>The printed synonyms are additions. From the "crassa," and the
"absque denticulo," it is by no means improbable that some large exotic
species was intended. The proposed name was <i>niger</i>; and that word originally
formed part of the heading, but had been erased by Linnæus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. ungulatus.</span> <i>M.</i> læviusculus, valvis obliquis postice dilatatis, antice
apice.</p>

<p>"Lineis" was "tunicis" in the original. I do not consider that the
details of this species (the <i>M. rusticus</i> of the MS.) pertain, even generically,
to the <i>ungulatus</i> of the 'Systema.'</p>

<p>The large <i>Mytilus</i> represented by Gualtieri was not quoted: the reference,
on the contrary, was to the two <i>Modiolæ</i> depicted by Rumphius
("Rump. 151. t. 46. f. B. C.") and to their Kleinian names ("Klein, 127.
Musculus acutus vulgaris, a. b."); and to that genus, rather than to
<i>Mytilus</i>, does the account of the suture, and the final remark, apply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. modiolus.</span> <i>M.</i> lævis, cardine sublaterali, margine dorsali dilatato.</p>

<p>The erroneous, yet approximate, synonyms of Rumphius and Gualtieri
(the 4 H's of whose engraving represent 4 different shells) were not
quoted in the original. The species (for want of a good figure) was not
clearly defined until the twelfth edition of the 'Systema.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. viridis.</span> <i>M.</i> lævis membranaceus, cardine terminali.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. ruber.</span> <i>M.</i> rugosus, valvulis obliquis, postice dilatatis, margine
antico apicem æquante.</p>

<p>The preceding mussel spoken of was not <i>viridis</i>, but <i>ungulatus</i>. The
reading was not "brevissimo, compresso," but "brevissime compresso."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. hirundo.</span> <i>Ost.</i> valvis bilobis, lobo anteriore angustiore longiore.</p>

<p>"Bonan. 2. f. 57" (error for 58) and "List. 220. f. 55" were quoted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<h3>PINNA.</h3>

<p>The definition was not precisely similar in words to that of the 'Systema,'
but the sense varied but little. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Testa oblonga, membranaceo-fragilis, basi angustata. Cardo nullus,
sed valvis altero latere coadunatis ut una appareat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. rudis.</span> <i>P.</i> rugosa squamis fornicatis per seriem digestis.</p>

<p>The name of this shell, identified (I think wrongly) by our author with
the one he had termed <i>rudis</i> in the 'Systema,' was originally <i>fornicata</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. nobilis.</span> <i>P.</i> squamis canaliculato-tubulosis subimbricatis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. muricata.</span> <i>P.</i> striata, squamis concavis ovatis acutis.</p>

<p>"List. Hist. t. 370. no. 215," and "Sloan. Hist. i. p. 254," were present
among the original synonyms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. rotundata.</span> <i>P.</i> squamis obsoletis, testæ margine rotundato.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. saccata.</span> <i>P.</i> nuda saccata erectiuscula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. digitiformis.</span> <i>P.</i> nuda digitiformis incurva.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. lobata.</span> <i>P.</i> nuda lobata.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In addition to the printed species, an anomalous <i>Pinna</i>, which I doubt
not was the <i>Lingula anatina</i>, is here described.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. viridis.</span> <i>P.</i> ovalis, basi compressa.</p>

<p>Generis dubii huc relata, donec certiora determinentur.</p>

<p>Testa utraque ovali-oblonga, viridis, intus magis pallida; quasi compressa,
et fere naviculata, acutior.</p>

<h3>ARGONAUTA.</h3>

<p>The intended name of this genus was <i>Cymbium</i>, the one applied to it by
Gualtieri.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. Argo.</span> <i>Cym.</i> carina dentata.</p>

<p>"Bonan. 1. f. 13," and "Klein, 3. t. 1. f. 3," were the unprinted synonyms.
The intended specific epithet was <i>C. papyraceum</i>.</p>

<h3>NAUTILUS.</h3>

<p>There was no definition of either this, or of the preceding genus, in the
written catalogue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. Pompilius.</span> <i>N.</i> apertura cordata, anfractibus contiguis.</p>

<p>The unprinted synonyms were "Bonan. 1, f. 1, 2," "Breyn. Polyth.
14," "Pet. Amb. t. 3. f. 7," "Pet. Gaz. t. 99. f. D," "Klein, 2. t. 1.
f. 1, 2," and "Bellon. Aquat. 318. t. 382." Seba was not quoted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. spirula.</span> <i>N.</i> apertura orbiculari, anfractibus distantibus.</p>

<p>The I in the reference to Rumphius was a misprint for the written 1;
"Bon. 1. f. 39," "Breyn. Polyth. 21. f. 2," "Klein, 5. t. 1. f. 6," and
"Petropol. Mus. 532. n. 6," were the unprinted synonyms: "tubo" was
an emendation.</p>

<h3>CONUS.</h3>

<p>Testa oblonga, cylindrica, deorsum attenuata. Apertura longitudinalis.
Labium edentulum. Os non reflexum. Columella integra.</p>

<p>This most natural genus had the precise limits ordinarily assigned to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. marmoreus.</span> <i>C.</i> conicus fuscus, maculis ovatis albis.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>"Bonan. 3. f. 123" was an additional synonym; the "versus basin
transverse striata," and "subtruncata, apice prominulo," with the account
of the variety, were not found in the MS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. imperialis.</span> <i>C.</i> pictus fasciis flavis cingulisque linearibus albo
fuscoque articulatis.</p>

<p>The "obconica" was simply "conica"; there was no description of
the spire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. literatus.</span> <i>C.</i> conicus albus punctis fuscis.</p>

<p>The spire was not described: the reference to d'Argenville was I, not <i>Q</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. virgo.</span> <i>C.</i> striis convexis lævibus, basi cærulescente.</p>

<p>"Longa" was originally "magna": the erroneous reference to Gualtieri
was not inserted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. capitaneus.</span> <i>C.</i> conicus, basi fusca, spiræ anfractibus adscendentibus.</p>

<p>At least two species were confused; but, from the heading, it is clear that
<i>C. generalis</i>, rather than <i>C. capitaneus</i>, was the typical form: the latter
was the variety <i>g.</i></p>

<p>The V in the reference to Rumphius was a misprint for the written Y:
"Gualt. t. 20. f. G." and "Pet. Gaz. t. 27. f. O." were additional synonyms.
"Notata lituris undatis fuscis" was not in the manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. princeps.</span> <i>C.</i> flavus, lineis fusco-purpureis longitudinalibus ramosis.</p>

<p>"Sub" preceded "convexa."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Ammiralis.</span> <i>C.</i> basi punctato-scaber.</p>

<p>After "summus" was written "cingulo albo"; after "ordinarius,"
"cingulo nullo"; Seba was not quoted; "pruniformis" was the earlier
reading for "conico-convexa, pyriformis." The variety <i>a.</i> was described
as "circumdata lineis numerosis albis nigro articulatis, quarum quæ cylindrum
distinguit a spira latior maculis albis nigrisque majoribus alternantibus."
The variety <i>g.</i> was not originally present in the catalogue, but was
interpolated by Linnæus. "Hæc pretiosissima ut vendita fuerit 500 florenis"
was the final remark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. nobilis.</span> <i>C.</i> subcylindricus lævis glaber, spira acuta argute canaliculata.</p>

<p>"Cacumen" was a misprint for the written "acumen."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Genuanus.</span> <i>C.</i> pictus cingulis linearibus albo fuscoque articulatis.</p>

<p>A strange confusion took place between the details of <i>C. senator</i> and
<i>C. Genuanus</i>. The published description belonged to the former, the synonym
the latter, and should have preceded the following brief description:</p>

<p>"Testa conica, pallida, glauca, oblongiuscula. Lineæ 19 transversæ
fusco-nigræ s. purpurascentes albo interruptæ, alternæ sæpe angustiores.
Spira subconica, obtusa."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. glaucus.</span> <i>C.</i> emarginatus, basi striatus, spiræ inermis anfractibus
convexis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. monachus.</span> <i>C.</i> gibbus acutus, fusco-cærulescente nebulosus, basi
striatus.</p>

<p>Bonanni was not quoted in the written copy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. minimus.</span> <i>C.</i> cinerascens, punctis oblongis cinctus.</p>

<p>The original description has been much altered by Linnæus. It ran as
follows: "Testa ovata, glauco-cinerea, gibba, striæ transversales plus 30
punctis fuscis oblongis. Spira convexa, alba, maculis fuscis magnis transversis."
The cited figure does not even suit these meagre characteristics,
which might have been equally applied to <i>C. glaucus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. rusticus.</span> <i>C.</i> ovatus, basi rugoso-scaber, spira conica convexa.</p>

<p>The variety was not noticed, and d'Argenville was not quoted in the original
catalogue. "Flavo et glauco" should have been "flavo aut glauco,"
as written.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. mercator.</span> <i>C.</i> ovatus, albus fasciis reticulatis flavis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. betulinus.</span> <i>C.</i> subemarginatus, basi rugosus, spira planiuscula mucronata.</p>

<p>Seba was not cited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. figulinus.</span> <i>C.</i> emarginatus, basi rugosa, spira convexa acuta.</p>

<p>An additional synonym, "Rump. t. 31 (error for 33, there being no
number 1 in that plate) f. 1," was indicated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Ebræus.</span> <i>C.</i> ovatus albus fasciis nigris ex maculis transversis.</p>

<p>"Pet. Gaz. t. 99. f. 12." was quoted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. stercus-muscarum.</span> <i>C.</i> emarginatus, basi striatus, spiræ anfractibus
canaliculatis.</p>

<p>Of the two species confounded under this designation the <i>C. arenarius</i>
appeared as a variety in the manuscript. Of the typical form "Spira lævi,"
"Pet. Gaz. t. 75. f. 1," and "Rumph. Mus. t. 33. f. Z," were cited as
illustrations; the other synonyms were ascribed to "Var. α. coronatus
spinis obtusis." The colouring was not mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. varius.</span> <i>C.</i> scabro-coronatus, elongatus, spira coronata acuta.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. granulatus.</span> <i>C.</i> scaber inermis, striis lævibus.</p>

<p>The original size indicated was "magnitudine coryli."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. magus.</span> <i>C.</i> subcylindricus, fasciis longitudinalibus albo punctatis.</p>

<p>The erroneous figure of d'Argenville was not referred to; and the 32, Q
(as in the 'Systema'), not 34, A, of Rumphius was quoted as illustrative.
The final remark had been interpolated by Linnæus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. striatus.</span> <i>C.</i> ovato-oblongus gibbus nebulosus, striis tenuissimis
parallelis fuscis.</p>

<p>The "Cæterum testa minus ante convoluta est," is a press addition. "Pet.
Gaz. t. 98. f. 9." was correctly cited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. textile.</span> <i>C.</i> pictus venis reticulatis luteis, maculis luteis fuscisque.</p>

<p>The intended name (<i>C. drador</i>) was an amusing specimen of conchological
Latin: it was of course borrowed from d'Argenville's appellation of
"<i>Drap d'or</i>." "Columella ad postica quasi replicata est" was added in
the printing; the "luteo" was originally "albo"; the "subconica" was
"anfractibus subconicis"; and there was no mention of a variety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. aulicus.</span> <i>C.</i> pictus venis reticulatis fasciisque longitudinalibus interruptis
fuscis.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>"Columella postice replicata est," and the objectionable "obovato-sub,"
were not in the copy. No figures were cited in the original catalogue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. spectrum.</span> <i>C.</i> cærulescens, flavo-nebulosus, punctis striisque alboluteis.</p>

<p>The original description did not comprise those characteristics which are
so much at variance with the essentials of the <i>C. spectrum</i> of authors. The
following passages were omitted: "gibba, minus arcte convoluta" (this
replaced "conica"), "Columella postice striata et replicata. Intus testa
sub-cærulescens," "mucrone cingulis granulato."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. bullatus.</span> <i>C.</i> flavus, albo nebulosus.</p>

<p>The account of the variety, and the "vix tuberculata," were absent from
the manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. geographus.</span> <i>C.</i> oblongus gibbus coronatus.</p>

<p>The Rumphian name was the one attached to this species in the written
copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. terebellum.</span> <i>C.</i> scaber inermis, striis tuberculatis.</p>

<p>The synonyms attached to the published details were "Gualt. Test.
t. 25. f. L.&mdash;Arg. Conch. t. 16. f. P.&mdash;Rumph. t. 33. f. EE." Now these harmonize
with both the heading and the description, and clearly indicate the
<i>C. Nussatella</i> of the 'Systema'!</p>

<p>The details attached to the published synonyms (which latter belonged to
the <i>C. terebellum</i> of the 'Systema,' and to which were joined "Gualt. t. 23.
f. O.&mdash;"Bonan. 3. f. 57.&mdash;Pet. Amb. t. 13. f. 24,") ran as follows:</p>

<p>"Testa cylindracea, glabra, antice angustior, desinens in spiram attenuatam,
anfractibus 3. Basis truncata, tennis. Columella non torta, sed involuta.
Color pallidus."</p>

<h3>CYPREA.</h3>

<p>Testa ovata lævis involuta. Apertura linearis, utrinque dentata. Spira
occultata intra testam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. mappa.</span> <i>C.</i> subturbinata characterisata, macula longitudinali dentata.</p>

<p>"Pet. Amb. t. 16. f. 2." was an omitted synonym. The terminal remark
is an improvement upon the earlier "Noscitur linea utrinque dentata in
superficie scripta."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Arabica.</span> <i>C.</i> subturbinata characterisata, macula longitudinali
simplici.</p>

<p>"Denticulis testaceis" and the description of the variety were additions
by the hand of Linnæus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Argus.</span> <i>C.</i> subturbinata subcylindrica, maculis annularibus.</p>

<p>The synonyms of Petiver (t. 97. f. 6) and Bonanni (f. 263), quoted in
the 'Systema,' were also present in the MS., where "2. s. 1" was in the
place of "duabus." The "pallidis" was a misprint for the written "pallidæ."
The account of the variety was subsequent to the copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. testudinaria.</span> <i>C.</i> obtusa cylindrica, extremitatibus depressis.</p>

<p>"Pet. Amb. t. 8. f. 7." was an unprinted synonym.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. carneola.</span> <i>C.</i> subturbinata pallida, fasciis incarnatis.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. talpa.</span> <i>C.</i> subturbinata violacea, fasciis pallidis.</p>

<p>"Pet. Amb. t. 16. f. 1." was an unprinted synonym: "pallide flavescens"
was the earlier reading for "testacea." The final remark was not in the
copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Amethystea.</span> <i>C.</i> subturbinata, dorso violaceo.</p>

<p>Rumphius was not originally cited as illustrative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Vanelli.</span> <i>C.</i> subturbinata, maculata punctis lutescentibus.</p>

<p>"Obsoletis" was originally in the place of "acutis": the "sæpe lutescentibus"
was an addition of the press. <i>C. Ovum Vanelli</i> was the intended
designation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. lota.</span> <i>C.</i> subturbinata alba, denticulis subulatis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. fragilis.</span> <i>C.</i> subturbinata gibba fragilis, obsolete fasciata.</p>

<p>Linnæus himself inserted this heading, with the first three lines of the
printed details, in the manuscript copy. Neither the reference, nor the
longer account of the variety (evidently a different species) appeared there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. caput-serpentis.</span> <i>C.</i> obtusa triquetro-gibba, postice obtusiuscula.</p>

<p>"Fusis" was the earlier reading for "confertis."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Mauritiana.</span> <i>C.</i> obtusa triquetro-gibba, postice depresso-acuta.</p>

<p>"Pet. Gaz. t. 96. f. 8. ex Insula Mauritii" was added in the manuscript:
"fuscus" was the earlier version of "fusco-testaceus."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. vitellus.</span> <i>C.</i> subturbinata livida, maculis albis.</p>

<p>The published reference was substituted for "Bonan. 3. f. 254," a more
characteristic figure: "maxima ex parte distincta, sed" followed "Spira."
"Albida," not "alba," was the tint at first ascribed to the base.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. mus.</span> <i>C.</i> obtusa subovalis gibba cinerea, fascia longitudinali fusca.</p>

<p>Our author himself inserted the account of this species in the manuscript.
Seba was not quoted. "Habitat in Carthagena" was appended to the
description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. tigris.</span> <i>C.</i> obtusa ovata, postice obtusa.</p>

<p>In the synonym of Rumphius, 36 is a misprint for 38: the erroneous
reference to the H of Gualtieri was not in the copy, where "Pet. Gaz. t. 96.
f. <i>7</i>" was indicated as illustrative. The printed additions were "aut alba,"
"fusco-ferrugineis" (in lieu of "fuscis"), and "s. alba, quasi exarata; postice
subcylindrica, truncata"; the previous words "Linea, &amp;c." of that
sentence were also absent from the original description, but had been inserted
by the hand of Linnæus. "Postice" preceded "planiusculo," and
"subviolaceo" followed "nitore."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. lynx.</span> <i>C.</i> oblongo-ovata, linea flavescente, postice acutiuscula.</p>

<p>No variety was mentioned in the written copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Isabella.</span> <i>C.</i> obtusa cylindrica, extremitatibus luteis.</p>

<p>"Pet. Amb. t. 16. f. 16." was cited in the manuscript, where the final
remark was wanting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. onyx.</span> <i>C.</i> umbilicata, subtus fusca.</p>

<p>Neither of the synonyms was quoted in the copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. succincta.</span> <i>C.</i> umbilicata, labio interiore utraque extremitate rotundato.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>The entire account of this shell (the <i>C. bicincta</i> of the MS.) was added
to the copy by our author.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. ziczac.</span> <i>C.</i> umbilicata, subtus lutea punctis fuscis.</p>

<p>None of the cited figures were referred to in the original, where "interiore"
stood in the place of the printed "utroque fusco."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. hirundo.</span> <i>C.</i> umbilicata, supra cærulescente.</p>

<p>"Sparsis", "s. fusca", "necnon macula, &amp;c." were emendations of
the press: "postice" preceded "fere marginato" in the original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. asellus.</span> <i>C.</i> umbilicata alba, fasciis tribus fuscis.</p>

<p>"Pet. Amb. t. 16. f. 18." and "Pet. Gaz. t. 97. f. 11." were cited in
the copy as illustrative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. cribraria.</span> <i>C.</i> umbilicata, maculis albis.</p>

<p>"Margo" preceded "adscendens" in the copy, in which "livide flavo"
was found in place of "luteo": "flavicantibus" was omitted. The intended
name was <i>C. Argiolus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. errones.</span> <i>C.</i> umbilicata, macula testacea æquali.</p>

<p><i>Erratica</i> was the original specific appellation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. moneta.</span> <i>C.</i> marginate-nodosa.</p>

<p>"Pet. Gaz. t. 97. f. 8." and "Pet. Amb. t. 16. f. 8." were omitted in
printing; "subflavescente" followed "convexo"; "subtus planiuscula"
and "incisis" were absent. In place of the final remark (added, however,
by the hand of our author), there originally stood "Noscitur tuberibus
quinque elevatis."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. annulus.</span> <i>C.</i> marginata annulo flavo.</p>

<p>The "s. rotundata" was added in printing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. erosa.</span> <i>C.</i> marginata flava albo-punctata.</p>

<p>"Undique aspersa" and "Macula fusca notat medium utriusque lateris"
are the printed emendations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. helvola.</span> C. marginata, postice crenata, subtus flava immaculata,
supra albo punctulata.</p>

<p>The final remark was unwritten, and the size not mentioned: "marginis
gibbi" was "margine exteriore gibbo", and "subcrenati" was "latere
subcrenato."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. stolida.</span> <i>C.</i> marginata variegata cinereo testaceoque.</p>

<p>"Quinque" and "adspersis" were not in the original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. ocellata.</span> <i>C.</i> marginata lutea, ocellis nigris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. flaveola.</span> <i>C.</i> marginata fulva, albo punctata.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. poraria.</span> <i>C.</i> marginata subviolacea, albo punctata.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. pediculus.</span> <i>C.</i> transversim sulcata.</p>

<p>"List. 168. t. 3. f. 17." and "Barr. t. 1326. f. 28." were cited in addition
to the printed synonyms. The last four words of the description were
not in the copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. nucleus.</span> <i>C.</i> sulcata punctata tuberculis, rostrata.</p>

<p>"Pet. Amb. t. 16 f. 11." was cited as illustrative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. staphylæa.</span> <i>C.</i> punctis elevatis sine striis, subrostrata.</p>

<p>The printed "minus" has been substituted for the earlier "vix";
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
"lutea" for "flava"; and "totam basin" for "maximum partem baseos."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. globulus.</span> <i>C.</i> rostrata lævis.</p>

<p>The printed additions were "alba s.", "extremitate utraque" (in place
of "postice"), "Superficies punctis vix manifestis notata", and "excurrentes
in strias".</p>

<h3>BULLA.</h3>

<p>Testa subrotunda, inflata, lævis. Apertura oblonga, non utrinque dentata.
Spira obsoleta. Columella obliqua.</p>

<p>The <i>Murex ficus</i> and <i>rapa</i> of the printed edition were originally located
in this genus, from which <i>Auris Midæ</i>, <i>Auris Judæ</i>, and <i>achatina</i> were excluded:
the two former were placed in <i>Morion</i>, the last in <i>Buccinum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. ovum.</span> <i>B.</i> birostris, labio dentato.</p>

<p>"Arg. t. 21. f. A." "Pet. Gaz. t. 94. f. 7." "Pet. Amb. t. 8. f. 6."
were additional references in the written copy: "magnitudine ovi gallinacei",
"apice et basi producta", were emendations during the printing.
The "dilatata" was originally modified by a "parum."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. volva.</span> <i>B.</i> birostris, rostris elongatis striatis.</p>

<p>"List. t. 711. f. 63" had been added to the copy by the hand of Linnæus.
The mode of reference (not, as in the earlier writings, by sections
and chapters) evinces that this addition was, in all probability, subsequent
to the publication of the work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. verrucosa.</span> <i>B.</i> angulata, aucta utrinque puncto osseo.</p>

<p>The correct synonyms of "Arg. t. 21. f. M." and "Pet. Gaz. t. 97.
f.22." were found in the manuscript: the printed emendations were, "magnitudine
ovi passerini", "uti anterius", and "granis duobus" for the earlier
"punctis."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. gibbosa.</span> <i>B.</i> angulata, cingulo elevato.</p>

<p>"Bonan. 249", "List. t. 711. f. 64", "Pet. Gaz. t. 15. f. 5", were
cited in the copy: "præcedentis magnitudine", "solidiorque", with the
modification of "cylindrica" by a preceding "sub", were press emendations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. naucum.</span> <i>B.</i> rotundata pellucida.</p>

<p>The size was not at first mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. ampulla.</span> <i>B.</i> rotundata opaca.</p>

<p>The printed "nulla" replaced the earlier "descendens, nuda", and
"pallido-testacea" the written "albida." The "antice, nullus vero postice"
was an emendation of the press.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. physis.</span> <i>B.</i> spira obtusa, lineis crispata.</p>

<p>"Sæpe", "hiansque", "tenue", and the name, are not to be found in
the written copy: "apicem" was the reading for the printed "ventrem,
aduatum."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. amplustre.</span> <i>B.</i> spira elevata, fasciis incarnatis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. pallida.</span> <i>B.</i> spira elevata acuta, corpore cylindrico.</p>

<p>So very many changes has this puzzling species experienced in the
works of our author, that it has been thought advisable to transcribe the
written description from the manuscript copy:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>Testa ovato-cylindrica, glabra. Spira convexo-conica, mucronata. Columella
multum torta. Color lividus, longitudinaliter grisco undulatus.</p>

<p>This evidently was a very different shell from the four-plaited, pale pink,
and often variegated specimen described in the printed copy. The description
of the outer lip, the name, and the terms "solida", "lævigata,
obsoletior" were, likewise, additions of the press.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. canaliculata.</span> <i>B.</i> cylindrica lævis, spiræ anfractibus canaliculatis.</p>

<p>The entire account of this species was added to the manuscript in the
Linnean handwriting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. achatina.</span> <i>Buc.</i> glabrum, apertura integra.</p>

<p>"Colum. Aphr. 18. t. 16" was the omitted synonym: "vel inæqualiter
ovata" and the entire account of the base (merely described as "vix manifeste
emarginata") were the printed additions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. Auris-Midæ.</span> <i>Morion</i> ovali-oblongum, spira rugosa, labio interiore
bidentato.</p>

<p>Figure 122 of Klein's seventh plate was correctly quoted as illustrative:
"crudæ" preceded "niger."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. Auris-Judæ.</span> <i>Morion</i> oblongus, spira lævi, labio interiore tridentato.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. solidula.</span> <i>B.</i> ovata opaca striata, spira elevata.</p>

<p>I do not doubt, from the "ovata", that <i>Tornatella flammea</i> was the shell
originally here intended; for the inharmonious account of the inner lip
(as well as of the outer one) was not found in the manuscript,&mdash;from which,
too, the erroneous reference to Bonanni was at first absent. The "acutiuscula"
was "obtusiuscula": the "postice rotundata, antice acuta" was
an improvement upon the earlier "pone gibba."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. livida.</span> <i>B.</i> spira elevata obtusa, corpore cylindrico.</p>

<p>This heading makes no mention of the columellar plication of the shell
so named in the 'Systema,' and confirms my surmise of their distinctiveness.
The name <i>livida</i> was not originally attached to the description, but
had been added (together with "obsoletis") by Linnæus, from a mistaken
identification.</p>

<p>There has evidently been some error in the comparison with <i>Voluta Caffra</i>.
I suspect that <i>Conus bullatus</i> was meant, as the contrasting characters
answer admirably. "Differt a <i>B. pallida</i> et <i>livida</i>, quod testa solida&mdash;anfractus
spiræ canaliculati". This passage shows that "fragilis et spiræ
anfractus obtusæ" referred to <i>livida</i>, not to <i>Caffra</i>.</p>

<h3>VOLUTA.</h3>

<p>Testa oblonga, subconvexa, basi emarginata, replicata in canalem rectum.
Columella plicata oblique. Labio integro.</p>

<p>The genus appears to comprehend precisely the same members as in the
published edition. They were arranged in sections exactly corresponding
with the Lamarckian genera of <i>Oliva</i>, <i>Voluta</i>, <i>Mitra</i>, and <i>Marginella</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. porphyria.</span> <i>V.</i> spira basi obliterata, labio medio retuso.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>Linnæus spoilt his excellent earlier description by his attempted emendations.
The interpolated "Faux sæpius rufescens" (misprinted virescens),
and the reference to Gualtieri's figure O. (<i>O. erythrostoma</i>), formed no part
of the original version.</p>

<p>The "Varictas fere sola est <i>V. Olivæ</i>" was an afterthought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Oliva.</span> <i>V.</i> spiræ basi reflexa.</p>

<p>The synonyms were thus distributed. To var <i>a</i>, Rumph. t. 39. f. 2, and
Gualt. t. 23. f. B; to var. <i>g</i>, Rumph. t. 39. f. 3; to var. <i>e</i>, Arg. t. 16.
f. R; to var. <i>d</i> ("Cæsius atro-undatus," not "Fusco undulatus" as printed),
Rumph. t. 39. f. 4. The expressions "ponderosa" and "magis sulcatum"
were not in the original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Ispidula.</span> <i>V.</i> spira adscendente, margine unico.</p>

<p>"Pet. Gaz. t. 59. f. 8," cited in the 'Systema,' was also written in the
manuscript: not so the "Varietas forte præcedentis <i>V. Olivæ</i>." None
of the drawings exhibit the produced spire, which must have resembled
that of <i>O. jaspidea</i>. The earlier name was <i>ispida</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. glabella.</span> <i>V.</i> ovata lævis, labii margine reflexo, basi rotundata.</p>

<p>The reference to Gualtieri (a doubtful figure) was not originally inserted.
The intended name was <i>V. polita</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Caffra.</span> <i>V.</i> fusiformis lævis.</p>

<p>The absurdity of asserting, in relation to this and the next species, that
each resembled the other, but was larger, arose from the circumstance that
when our author, in revising the labours of his amanuensis, added "sed
major," he omitted to erase it from the following species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. vulpecula.</span> <i>V.</i> fusiformis angulata inermis, transversim striata.</p>

<p>Of the ample details the first two paragraphs only were found in the
manuscript. The proposed name was <i>V. picta</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. plicaria.</span> <i>V.</i> fusiformis, angulis antice subspinosis.</p>

<p>The intended appellation <i>angulata</i> was changed from an erroneous impression
of the identity of the species with the <i>Turricula plicata</i> of Rumphius.
"Mucronatis" and "albidus" were emendations. "Bonan. 8.
f. 65" was referred to, as in the 'Systema'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. pertusa.</span> <i>V.</i> fusiformis, labro denticulato, striata punctis pertusis.</p>

<p><i>V. denticulata</i> was the name originally proposed for this <i>Mitre</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Mitra.</span> <i>V.</i> fusiformis lævis, labro denticulato.</p>

<p>The final paragraph was not in the manuscript, where "Bonan. 3. t. 119,
120", and "Klein, 36. Mitra episcopi", the former cited in the 'Systema',
the latter a mere name, were quoted as illustrative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. musica.</span> <i>V.</i> spinis obtusiusculis, columella plicis 8.</p>

<p>The reference to the letters X. and Y. of Gualtieri (neither of which are
illustrative) stood not thus in the original: the characteristic Z. of that
work was the figure really cited. The printed edition has been enlarged
by an "ob" before "ovato" the addition of "solida", and the description
of the lips.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. vespertilio.</span> <i>V.</i> spinis acutis, columella plicis 4.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>The only printed additions are "ob" before "ovato", "s. glauca", and
"fuscis lineis" in place of the "saturatius."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Æthiopica.</span> <i>V.</i> spinis fornicatis cingentibus apicem papillarem.</p>

<p>"Habitat in mari Pacifico", "Pet. Amb. t. 7. f. 5" (copied from Rumphius,
t. 31. f. B.), and "Bonan. t. 3 f. 1" (cited in the 'Systema') were
the unprinted additions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. cymbium.</span> The entire account of this shell was in the handwriting
of Linnæus, and inserted at a later period than the mass of species. The
decided reference to Gualtieri <i>was not in the manuscript</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. olla</span> was not mentioned in the written catalogue.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In addition to the species published in the 'Museum,' the following were
also characterized in the manuscript:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. faba.</span> <i>V.</i> ovata, antice subplicata, labii exterioris margine reflexo,
basi rotundata.</p>

<p>Bonan. 3. f. 49.</p>

<p>Testa magnitudine vix fabæ, ovalis, lævis, antice subplicata, livida, punctis
fuscis aspersa. Spira testæ <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> brevior, subplicata. Labium exterius reflexum,
basi rotundatum integrum.</p>

<p>This was evidently the shell so designated in the 'Systema.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. granulata.</span> <i>V.</i> fusiformis, sulcis longitudinalibus, striisque transversalibus.</p>

<p>Rumph. Mus. t. 29. f. V.</p>

<p>Arg. Conch. t. 12. f. V.</p>

<p>Testa facie antecedentis, sed sulci et striæ contrariæ, fusiformis, sulcis
longitudinalibus elevatis obtusis, striis transversalibus exaratis. Color cinereus,
fasciis linearibus 2 rubris ex punctis. Spira longitudine ventris.
Apertura præcedentis.</p>

<p>This was the <i>V. sanguisuga</i> of the 'Systema.'</p>

<p>The preceding species referred to was</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. lima.</span> <i>V.</i> fusiformis, sulcis transversis, striisque longitudinalibus.</p>

<p>Rumph. Mus. t. 28. f. T.</p>

<p>Testa fusiformis, scabriuscula, striis longitudinalibus secundum testam,
et sulcis secundum anfractus adscendentibus margine acutiusculis. Color
albidus sulcis elevatis rubris&mdash;albidus sulcis elevatis flavis albo interruptis.
Spira longitudine ventris. Apertura oblonga, intus alba. Basis acuta,
emarginata. Labium exterius integrum; interius nullum. Columella dentibus
4 obliqius.</p>

<p>These features fairly enough suit the <i>Mitra filosa</i>, generally, and with
reason, supposed to be the <i>V. filaris</i> of the 'Mantissa.' The cited figure
however, seems <i>M. gracilis</i> of Reeve.</p>

<h3>BUCCINUM.</h3>

<p>The species which compose this group in the 'Museum' were originally
separated under many generic designations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Buccinum.</span> Testa ovata, ventricosa. Apertura integra, semilunaris,
superne extrorsum, postice introrsum.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Cassida.</span> Testa ovata, gibba. Cauda reflexa oblique. Apertura
longitudinalis, obliqua.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Lyra.</span> Testa ovata, ventricosa. Apertura ovata, patens, pone submarginata.
Labium interius nullum. Columella compressa, nitida.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Turricula.</span>  (No definition: evidently intended for all the turreted
shells.)</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Morion.</span> Testa oblonga, inermis. Apertura oblonga, labio interiore
reflexo unidentato.</p>

<p>In the first were located the <i>Dolia</i>, and <i>B. echinophorum</i>; in the second
the <i>Cassides</i>, with <i>B. papillosum</i> and <i>arcularia</i>; in the third the <i>Harpæ</i>
and <i>Purpuræ</i>; in the fourth the <i>Terebræ</i>; in the fifth <i>B. glans</i>, <i>spiratum</i>,
<i>glabratum</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. undosum</i> was located in <i>Murex</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. perdix.</span> <i>B.</i> umbilicatum subsulcatum, basi recta.</p>

<p>The proposed name was <i>B. pennatum</i>, adopted from Rumphius: "lunari-patula"
was not in the manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. pomum.</span> <i>B.</i> exumbilicatum, labio utroque dentato.</p>

<p>"Barr. Ic. t. 1325. f. 12" (cited in the 'Systema'), and "Klein, 95.
Semicassis, striata, costosa", were the additional synonyms of the manuscript:
"s. sulcata", "nullum, interne", "at vero in adultioribus accrescit
planum album", were subsequent emendations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. dolium.</span> <i>B.</i> emarginatum subsulcatum rugosum, labio exteriore
reflexo dentato.</p>

<p>The <i>Dolium fimbriatum</i>, or, as Deshayes prefers it, <i>D. Minjac</i> (the Malay
name was Bia Minjac in Rumphius, who preceded Adanson), was assuredly
the shell described in the 'Museum', as the recorded dentation of the outer
lip clearly manifests. An excellent figure of it in Petiver ("Gaz. t. 99.
f. 11") was cited in the original copy, where the drawing of Gualtieri was
not referred to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. echinophorum.</span> <i>B.</i> (changed to <i>Cassida</i>) tuberibus ("quaterna
serie" interpolated) nodosum.</p>

<p>The reference to Rumphius was correctly written 1, not I, in the original,
where "albido-flavescens" was the indicated colouring. The printed emendations
were "quadruplici s. quintuplici", instead of "triplici", and the
entire account of the aperture, which at first ran simply as follows, "Labium
exterius crassius, margine tenuiore, interne subrugosum, obsolete
dentatum."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. tuberosum.</span> <i>B.</i> tuberibus gemina serie nodosum.</p>

<p>The entire published account of this species had been interpolated by
Linnæus in the written copy, with the exception of the "color pallidus."
The "nodis anterioribus" was a misprint for "nodis acutioribus."</p>

<p>Gualtieri's admirable figure of the <i>Cassis tuberosa</i> of authors was not,
however, cited, which confirms my statement that the species of the 'Museum'
was not the <i>Cassis</i> usually so designated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. cornutum.</span> <i>Cas.</i> acuminibus antice cingentibus, superficic reticulata.</p>

<p>The I in the reference to Rumphius was a misprint for the written 1:
"maculata" was originally "maculis griseis."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. rufum.</span> <i>Cas.</i> nodis sparsis.</p>

<p>"Pyri" was a misprint for the written "pugni". Neither the "maculis
fuscis" nor the "Variat tota albo colore" were originally present. The
Rumphian name <i>rubra</i> was the one written.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. flammeum.</span> <i>Cas.</i> longitudinaliter striata, antice subnodosa.</p>

<p>To the solitary synonym our author had added "List. t. 1004. f. 69"
and "Sloan. Hist. 2. p. 242. n. 2". The final remark was not in the copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. testiculus.</span> <i>Cas.</i> lævis, striis longitudinalibus, sulcis transversalibus.</p>

<p>"Vix ullus" was at first "nullus": "læve" was not present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. decussatum.</span> <i>Cas.</i> lævis, striis decussatis, labio exteriore dentato.</p>

<p>"Bonan. Clas. 3. t. 157" was an additional synonym.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. areola.</span> <i>Cas.</i> glabra, spira papillosa.</p>

<p>The erroneous references to Gualtieri, and to the figure 2 of Rumphius,
were not present in the original, nor was there any allusion made to the
sculpture of the inner lip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. erinaceus.</span> <i>Cas.</i> subsulcata, antice nodosa, labio edentulo, postice
extrorsum denticulato.</p>

<p>The entire account of this <i>Cassis</i> was interpolated by Linnæus in the
pages of his amanuensis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. glaucum.</span> <i>Cas.</i> glabra, antice muricata, labio dentato, postice extrorsum
denticulato.</p>

<p>The superfluous A in the reference to Gualtieri was a misprint: "inferne"
was "interne": the "acuminata" and "marginatum" were emendations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. vibex.</span> <i>Cas.</i> glabra, labio edentulo, postice extrorsum denticulato.</p>

<p>The figures 8 and 9 of Rumphius were not cited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. papillosum.</span> <i>Cas.</i> papillis decussatis, labio tenui, extus denticulato,

<p>"Rectum" followed "exterius" in the written copy, wherein "s. albidus"
and "antice sinu excavata" were not to be found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. glans.</span> <i>Morion</i> labio exteriore denticulato, interiore bidentato.</p>

<p>"Labium exterius margine postico denticulato" was omitted in printing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. arcularia.</span> <i>Cas.</i> longitudinaliter sulcata, labio exteriore tenui,

<p><span class="smcap">B. costatum.</span> <i>Lyra</i> costis longitudinalibus, antice prominulis, alternis

<p>This diagnosis but ill suits the <i>Many-ridged Harp</i>, which, of late, has
been considered identical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. harpa.</span> <i>Lyra</i> costis longitudinalibus antice mucronatis.</p>

<p>The shell is described in the MS. as "striata subtilissime longitudinaliter",
and "Pet. Amb. t. 2. f. 2", "Pet. Gaz. t. 48. f. 13" (the latter quoted
also in the 'Systema') are there substituted for the reference to Gualtieri.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
The printed additions are considerable; to wit, "costæ vero striis transversis",
"anfractibus costis mucronatis", "denticulatum."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. Persicum.</span> <i>Lyra</i> læviuscula, labii margine crenulato.</p>

<p>The erroneous citation of Grew (t. 9. f. 5, 6) in the 'Systema' had been
adopted in the manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. patulum.</span> <i>Lyra</i> muricata spinis obtusis.</p>

<p>Neither the erroneous reference to Gualtieri, plate 51. f. A (which was
designed for <i>Purpura hæmastoma</i>), nor the "color interne rufescens", is to
be found in the manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. smaragdulus.</span> <i>Lyra</i> glaberrima, columella denticulata.</p>

<p>Neither the erroneous reference to d'Argenville, nor the specific name
derived from his figure, is to be found in the MS. The proposed appellation
was <i>L. vitrea</i>. "Simillima Cassid, lapillo, sed glabra, et columella
crenata" is the unprinted remark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. spiratum.</span> <i>Morion</i> umbilicatus, anfractibus distinctis canaliculo.</p>

<p>The specified colouring was "alba, maculis longitudinalibus fuscis";
"pone bifidum" followed "integrum." The intended name was <i>M. canaliculatus</i>.</p>

<h3>STROMBUS.</h3>

<p>This genus, rendered more natural by the omission of <i>S. lividus</i> and
<i>ater</i> (assigned to <i>Turricula</i>), appeared under the designation of <span class="smcap">Harpago</span>
with the following definition:&mdash;</p>

<p>Testa depressa, nodosa. Apertura longitudinalis. Labium antice dilatatum
ultra basin.</p>

<p>The <i>Strombi</i> of the manuscript were the young of this genus (erased by
Linnæus) and certain Lamarckian <i>Fusi</i>, <i>Pyrulæ</i>, and <i>Fasciolariæ</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. chiragra.</span> <i>Har.</i> labii spinis lævibus 6, extimis recurvis, fauce
striata.</p>

<p>"Bar. Icon. 327. f. 1." was an additional synonym.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. scorpius.</span> <i>Har.</i> labii spinis nodosis <i>7</i>, fauce striata.</p>

<p>The published account was enlarged by the following passages, which are
not to be found in the written copy: "crenulato cincta", "lato, brevi",
"s. incarnata", "s. testaceo-nebulosus". "Distinctum" was originally
"obscuro", and "repandus, inflexus" was "denticulatus."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. lambis.</span> <i>Har.</i> labii spinis lævibus <i>7</i>, fauce lævi.</p>

<p>"Bar. Icon. t. 1326. f. <i>7</i>" was the synonym omitted in printing. The
name was borrowed from d'Argenville.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. millepeda.</span> <i>Har.</i> labii spinis lævibus 10.</p>

<p>"Anteriora" was "posteriora" in the manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. lentiginosus.</span> <i>Har.</i> labio inermi integro rotundato, angulis pluribus
nodosis.</p>

<p>The "aut marginatum" was "fragile, diaphanum", so that a young shell
appears to have furnished the materials for description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. gallus.</span> <i>Har.</i> labio inermi mucronato, cingulo dorsali spinoso.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. Auris-Dianæ.</span> <i>Har.</i> labio inermi muricato, cauda recurva, lobo incurvato.</p>

<p>The "32. f. II." was a misprint for the written "17. f. O." The printed
additions are "usque" and "Color testaceo et albido nebulosus."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. pugilis.</span> <i>Har.</i> labio inermi obtuso, spira spinosa distincta, basi
emarginata.</p>

<p>"Nitida", and "sed spira albida", were not found in the original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. Luhuanus.</span> <i>Har.</i> labio obtuso, antice posticeque emarginata.</p>

<p>Few of the details were present in the original copy, but appear to have
been added, to discriminate the species from the allied <i>gibberulus</i>. "Spira
obtusa brevis" was added by the hand of Linnæus; "sæpe subplicati",
"postice lobo obsoleto instructum", "intus", "Columella nigricans",
"Cauda nulla, sed postice emarginata", were all absent from the MS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. gibberulus.</span> <i>Har.</i> labio inermi dorso lævi, spira repanda.</p>

<p>The printed additions are "subtus planiuscula", "læves", "fuscum",
and the final remark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. Latissimus.</span> <i>Har.</i> labio inermi rotundato, spira subnodosa breviore,
dorso lævi.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. epidromis.</span> <i>Har.</i> labio inermi dilatato, dorso lævi, spira subnodosa.</p>

<p>The <i>S. epidromis</i>, as it originally stood in the manuscript, was a recognizable
species, and precisely identical with the shell so named in the
'Systema'; for the erroneous reference to Gualtieri was not present,
neither was "carinato," nor any of the discordant details from "interius"
to the termination. As the printed description now stands, it would suit
<i>S. emarginatus</i> or <i>succinctus</i>, at the least, equally well. I doubt not our
author, when correcting the press, forgot his own species, and added the
partial essentials of one species to those of another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. Canarium.</span> <i>Har.</i> labio inermi dilatato, dorso spiraque lævibus.</p>

<p>The erroneous reference to plate 37 of Rumphius was not present in the
written copy, which contains the additional synonyms of "Pet. Gaz. t. 98.
f. 11", and "Klein, t. 4. f. 73": the latter was not there originally. The
early description has been improved, in the press, by the addition of
"obovata", "Faux lævis, alba", and "longitudinaliter subundulatus."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. vittatus.</span> <i>Har.</i> labiis inermibus, spiræ anfractibus vitta interstinctis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. urceus.</span> <i>Har.</i> labiis inermibus striatis, dorso nodoso.</p>

<p>The erroneous reference to Gualtieri was not present in the original, but
in place of it the 37. W. of Rumphius (<i>S. mutabilis</i>): "Spira testa brevior,
plicato-subnodosa" was, likewise, absent. "Klein, 49, urceus fimbriatus"
(a name for Rumph. t. 37. f. F &amp; W) was interpolated by our
author.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. ater.</span> <i>Turricula</i> labiata.</p>

<p>Neither the reference to Rumphius, nor the "et postice emarginatum"
were found in the original. This confirms my expressed belief that the
Museum species (to which no name was at first attached) was distinct from
that of the 'Systema.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. lividus.</span> <i>Turric.</i> labiata, anfractibus serie subspinosa.</p>

<p>This was located in a section of <i>Turricula</i> distinguished as having the
outer lip dilated and rounded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Besides the above, the following unprinted details were found in the
manuscript:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>Strombus gigas</i> was described at length under the appellation of
<i>Harpago gigas</i>.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> labio inermi rotundato, dorso spiraque subulato-spinosis.</p>

<p>Gualt. t. 34. f. A. Bar. Icon. 1727. f. 7.</p>

<p>Testa gibba, maxima, magnitudine capitis. Cauda obtusa. Spira spinis
patentibus, subulatis, validis.  Anfractus desinens in dorso spina. Series
in dorso spinarum maximarum ferme conicarum. Labium dilatatum, rotundatum,
spira longius, vix adnatum spiræ. Faux glabra, nitida, incarnata.
Color pallidus.</p>

<p>The <i>Strombus dentatus?</i> was also defined (without a specific appellation)
by the following characters:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> labio dentato, testa lævis, plicato-nodosa.</p>

<p>Testa simillima reliquis, longitudine articuli digiti, lævis, flavescens, subplicata,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
plicis antice acuminatis nodis. Spira acutiuscula, similiter plicata,
nodosa. Labium exterius minus dilatatum, postice margine dentatum et
interne fuscum, striatum. Labium internum crassum, integrum, læve.</p>

<p>The <i>Strombus palustris</i>, although not published until the twelfth edition
of the 'Systema,' had been already defined in the 'Museum' as <i>Turricula
cornea</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tur.</i> decussatim rugosa, labio dilatato.</p>

<p>Rumph. 101. t. 30. f. Q. Strombus palustris.</p>

<p>Testa crassa, rudis, pyramidalis, cornea aut plumbea, anfractibus 12 et
ultra, secundum spiras transversim aliquot striis exarata, longitudinaliter
subplicata, adcoque sine spinis rugosissima. Labium dilatatum, rotundatum,
concavum, edentulum.</p>

<h3>MUREX.</h3>

<p>The definition of this genus ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Testa subovata, spinosa. Apertura coarctata, ovata, desinens in canalem
tubuloso-conniventem.</p>

<p>This was evidently designed for the <i>Murices</i> proper. The other species
of the 'Museum' were distributed in the groups of <i>Cassis</i>, <i>Turricula</i>,
<i>Bulla</i>, and <i>Strombus</i>. The last was defined as follows; "Testa obverse
conica, nodosa, labium exterius angulum transversalem superne formans;
interius nullum. Columella incurva. Cauda integra."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. haustellum.</span> <i>M.</i> caudatus, subinermis, nodosus.</p>

<p>"Suturis" was originally "costis".  The printed emendations are "gibbis,
adglutinatis", "costati et nodosi", "subtus rima longitudinali clausa",
"margine", and the final remark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. tribulus.</span> <i>M.</i> caudatus spinis subulatis trifariis.</p>

<p>"Olear. Mus. t. 39. f. 1" was cited in the transcript, to which Linnæus
had added "Bonan. 269" and "List. t. 902. f. 22", all which synonyms
are present in the 'Systema.' The printed additions are "suturis 3 longitudinalibus,
adglutinatis, incrassatis", "secundum suturas: superficies
transversim striis elevatis distinctis", "recta".</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. cornutus.</span> <i>M.</i> caudatus, spinis subulatis serie gemina.</p>

<p>The s. in the reference to Rumphius was a misprint for the written 5:
"Pet. Gaz. t. 68. f. 12" (as in the 'Systema') was present in the copy.
The expressions "striata", "conicæ", "obliquo situ", and the final remark,
are the printed additions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. trunculus.</span> <i>M.</i> subcaudatus, spinis simplici serie.</p>

<p>The description of the tail and account of the variety were not originally
present: "suturis" was, at first, "plicis", and "adglutinatis" was "antrorsum
adnatis".</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. ramosus.</span> <i>M.</i> dædaleus triangularis, spira longitudine ventris.</p>

<p>Had the original manuscript been printed, the multitude of species confused
under this appellation would have been somewhat lessened. For the
cited figures of <i>M. inflatus</i> (Rumph. t. 26. f. A. and Gault. t. 38. f. A), with
that of another short-spired <i>Murex</i> (Arg. t. 19. f. C), were separated from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
the rest, and quoted for a <i>M. unguis-odor</i>, the brief definition of which was
"<i>M.</i> dædalens triangularis, spira ventre breviore."</p>

<p>The published details, and the drawings of the longer-spired and more
slender-bodied <i>Murices</i> (Rumph. t. 26. f. l; d'Arg. t. 19. f. E, H.), appeared
as <i>M. lichenoides</i>.</p>

<p>I consider, then, that in that event the <i>M. adustus</i> (Arg. t. 19. f. H.),
which would tolerably suit the definition, would have been considered the
typical form, and <i>M. axicornis</i> (Rumph. t. 26. f. l, and d'Arg. t. 19. f. E.),
the variety γ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. scorpio.</span> <i>M.</i> dædaleus quadrangularis, spira subcapitata.</p>

<p>The ill-judged final remark was not in the copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. saxatilis.</span> <i>M.</i> dædaleus quinquangularis, spira contigua.</p>

<p>The idea of this being a mere variety was not expressed in the original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. rana.</span> M. angulatus subdepressus, costis lateralibus.</p>

<p>The R. of d'Argenville was properly referred to the variety B. The
"alba", "sulcis transversis", and "Dorsum anfractum simplici cingulo
aculeato" were not in the copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. lampas.</span> <i>M.</i> angulatus tuberculis nodosis, cauda flexuosa, labio
interiore lævi.</p>

<p>The earlier reading of "una alterave ruga" was "uno alterove denticulo."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. femorale.</span> <i>M.</i> angulato-triqueter: angulis antrorsum acuminatis.</p>

<p>The intended name was <i>M. triqueter</i>. Grew's engravings (f. 7, 8) of the
species were correctly cited, and the erroneous reference to Rumphius was
not inserted. The printed additions were unimportant&mdash;"exarata", "repando",
"sub" before "edentula", and "levissime".</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. lotorium.</span> <i>M.</i> angulatus, tuberculis conicis, cauda flexuosa, labio
interno rugoso.</p>

<p>"Subter" was a misprint for the written "inter": the "ut in proximis"
was a printed addition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. rubecula.</span> <i>M.</i> angulatus, sulcis moniliformibus, costis lateralibus,
dorsalique.</p>

<p>"Gualt. t. 49. f. 1" was rightly cited as illustrative: "ex" preceded
"lineis".</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. reticularis.</span> <i>Cas.</i> inæqualis gibba reticulata, cauda elongata.</p>

<p>The erroneous reference to Rumphius was not present in the manuscript.
As corroborative of my expressed belief in the identity of the species described
in the 'Museum' with the <i>Triton ! mulus</i>, it may be observed, that
our author has wholly separated this and the allied <i>anus</i> from the true
<i>Tritons</i> and <i>Ranellæ</i>, and that the original heading corresponds accurately
with the peculiar characteristics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. anus.</span> <i>Cas.</i> inæqualis, gibba nodosa, labris rugosis.</p>

<p>"Pet. Gaz. t. 74. f. 9" and "Pet. Amb. t. 6. f. 4" were the unprinted
synonyms. The "rugis reticulato-intertextis", "irregularis", and "patens"
were emendations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. ricinus.</span> <i>M.</i> ecaudatus, ore utrinque dentato.</p>

<p>"Æqualibus, ad labium majoribus" was not in the copy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. capitellum.</span> <i>M.</i> ecaudatus ovatus, columella rugosa, labio edentulo,
superficie inermi rugosa.</p>

<p>"Alba" followed "edentula", and "Umbilicus ad basin" terminated
the description in the original: the word "striis" was a subsequent introduction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. turbinellus.</span> <i>M.</i> ecaudatus, turbinatus, columella dentata, spinis
explicatis.</p>

<p>The printed additions are "anteriores", "nodulosa", "alba", "Cauda vix
ulla", and "Variat colore albo spira longiore".</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Ceramicus.</span> <i>M.</i> ecaudatus, utrinque acuminatus, columella dentata,
spinis conicis.</p>

<p>"Rumph. t. 49. f. L." was an unpublished synonym.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. nodus.</span> <i>M.</i> ecaudatus ovatus, labio denticulato.</p>

<p>As "Gualt. t. 28. f. R." was quoted, and "aut nigris, conicis, obtusiusculis"
(a character which probably belonged to some distinct species
erroneously supposed to be a variety) was not inserted in the manuscript,
I feel convinced that the <i>Purpura hystrix</i> of authors was the species
designed in the 'Museum Ulricæ.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. hystrix.</span> <i>M.</i> ecaudatus edentulus, fauce lævi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. mancinella.</span> <i>M.</i> ecaudatus, edentulus fauce striata.</p>

<p>This original heading, and the absence of the erroneous synonym from
the MS., confirm the received opinion of the identity of the Museum
species (not that of the 'Systema') with <i>Purpura mancinella</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. hippocastanum.</span> <i>M.</i> ecaudatus edentulus, fauce edentula integra,
spinis serie triplici.</p>

<p>Gualtieri's erroneously cited figure was not indicated in the manuscript.
No specific name had been originally attached to the description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. melongena.</span> <i>M.</i> ecaudatus edentulus fauce patula lævi, spinis
serie duplici.</p>

<p>"Bonan. 3. f. 186" had been added to the synonymy by our author.
The details were less copious than in the published edition, "apice solo
acuminatus" being the meagre substitute for the entire description from
"Spira" to the end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. ficus.</span> <i>Bul.</i> caudata, striis reticulatis, spira obtusa.</p>

<p>"Pet. Amb. t. 6. f. 9" was an omitted synonym. The shell described
in the 'Museum' was assuredly not the <i>ficus</i> of most writers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. rapa.</span> <i>Bul.</i> caudata, striis longitudinalibus, spira acuta.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. fusus.</span> <i>Turric.</i> caudata lævis, labio dentato.</p>

<p>"Bonan. f. 121" and the name had been added to the MS. by Linnæus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Babylonius.</span> <i>Turric.</i> caudata, transversim angulo sulcata, labio
marginali versus basim sinu exciso.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. colus.</span> <i>Turric.</i> caudata striata, labio exteriore crenato.</p>

<p>The printed emendations were "longa" and "s. angulati." The name
was added by Linnæus. The following unnamed <i>Turricula</i> succeeded the
species in the manuscript copy:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>T.</i> caudata striata, longitudinaliter sulcata.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>Testa parva, striis plurimis secundum anfractus. Anfractus scabri, sulcis
longitudinalibus 15. Color anfractuum superne griseus inferne pallidus.
Apertura ovata. Rostrum baseos rectum, testæ dimidio brevius. Labium
tantum exterius integrum. An filia præcedentis?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. morio.</span> <i>Strom.</i> spira subnodosa, labio exteriore intus rugoso.</p>

<p>The synonymy, as might be expected (for Seba was unknown to Linnæus
when the descriptions were written), was not in the original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. cochlidium.</span> <i>Strom.</i> spira pyramidata, anfractibus planis.</p>

<p>The reference to Seba, the name, and the "Cauda subulata, longitudine
testæ" were not present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. canaliculatus.</span> <i>Strom.</i> spira subconvexa, anfractibus distantibus.</p>

<p>The "Anfractus distincti canaliculo per omnes spiras," the name, and
the reference to Seba, were the printed additions. "Habitat in Canada.
Kalm." was appended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Aruanus.</span> <i>Strom.</i> incurvus spinosus ventricosus, angulo obsoleto.</p>

<p>The objectionable name (for assuredly the <i>Buccinum Aruanum</i> of Rumphius
suits not "spinosus") was not present in the original, but had subsequently
been added by our author, who seems to have erased the original
"Habitat in Canada. Kalm." I doubt not that <i>Pyrula carica</i> was intended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. perversus.</span> <i>Strom.</i> inversus.</p>

<p>The wretched engraving of Gualtieri was not cited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Tritonis.</span> <i>Cas.</i> pyramidalis lævis, columella dentata.</p>

<p>"Bonan. 3. f. 188" stood in the place of Seba. The printed additions
were "plerisque", "et suturis variis alternis crassis", and the specific epithet.
"Genus difficile eruitur" was written after the description, and  the
following note erased:&mdash;"Ad genus retuli ob labium interius adnatum
in quibusdam latius, ob suturas verrucosas, ob caudam canaliculatam
parum elevatam, ob labium postice dentatum, quæ omnia affinitatem
arguunt."</p>

<p>The <i>Triton nodiferus</i> was probably designed by the following description,
which succeeded that of <i>M. Tritonis</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cas.</i> (corrected by Linnæus to <i>Murex</i>) <i>Neptuni</i>. <i>C.</i> pyramidalis nodosa,
columella dentata.</p>

<p>Testa maxime facie statura et colore præcedentis. Anfractuum angulus
summus nodis prominentibus, unde et spira nodosa evadit, quod non in
præcedente. Apertura præcedentis. Labium interius magis dilatatum,
maximeque planum. Columella non dentata. Habitat Constantinopoli.
Edw. Carleson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. trapezium.</span> <i>Strom.</i> spira nodosa, labio denticulato, columella
rugosa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. aluco.</span> <i>Turric.</i> recurvirostra, spinosa, serie simplici.</p>

<p>Gualtieri was not cited, and the reference was to "N. Strombus tuberosus"
(<i>Cerithium aluco</i>), not O. (<i>C. nodulosum</i>) of Rumphius. The inner
lip was described as "non adnatum, sed prominens": "s. fuscis", and
"Variat cauda recta, &amp;c.", were not in the original.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>Besides the published species, the following had been written, but omitted

t. 14. f. P. Gualt. Test. t. 57. f. D.</p>

<p>Testa lævis. Anfractus circiter 15, margine subcrenati. Color albus,
sæpius saturatior ad marginem anfractuum. Apertura ovata, rostro canaliculato,
recurvo. Labium interius adnatum, dente unico obsoleto.</p>

<p>This was evidently identical, from its synonymy, with the <i>M. vertagus</i> of
the 'Systema.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turricula senticosa.</span> <i>T.</i> reflexo-emarginata, costis reticulatis.</p>

<p>d'Arg. Conch. t. 12. f. O.</p>

<p>Testa gibba, costis sæpius 12 perpendiculari-obliquis, intertextis striis
lamellosis transversis ad anastomosases muricatis, unde admodum scabra
evadit. Anfractus ventricosi, sæpius x. Color griseus. Apertura ovata,
interne striata, emarginata, parum reflexa.</p>

<p>Evidently this was identical with the <i>M. senticosus</i> of the 'Systema.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. oleagineus.</span> <i>M.</i> angulis sulcis inæqualibus, labio interiore rugoso,
costis alternis.</p>

<p>Gualt. Test. t. 49. f. G. d'Arg. Conch. t. 13. f. M.</p>

<p>Habitus et structura <i>rubeculæ</i>, at octies major, nec vivide pictus, sed
colore testaceo fasciis fuscis longitudinalibus. Apertura intus saturate
crocea, rugis albis.</p>

<p>Apparently this was the <i>Triton pileare</i> of authors,&mdash;not the Mediterranean
shell (<i>T. corrugatus</i>) termed <i>M. pileare</i> in the 'Systema.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. pileus Helveticus.</span> <i>M.</i> angulis rotundatis, tuberculis conicis,
apertura utrinque canaliculata.</p>

<p>d'Arg. Conch, t. 12. f. D. Rumph. t. 28. f. D.</p>

<p>Testa ovata, admodum inæqualis, adspersa nodis conicis tuberculatis
inæqualibus. Costæ latere antico membranaceæ, primæ 2 oppositæ, reliquæ
alternæ. Color flavus. Apertura hians, antice et postice canaliculatæ,
faux intus striata. Labium exterius dentatum, intus dilatato-membranaceum.</p>

<p>This suits very fairly the <i>Triton lampas</i> of authors; far better, indeed,
than does the <i>M. Lampas</i> of the 'Museum Ulricæ.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. subulatus.</span> <i>M.</i> ecaudatus, pyramidalis.</p>

<p>Testa subulata instar turris, anfractuum undecim, reticulata striis elevatis
decussantibus punctis contiguationem eminentibus. Costæ oppositæ et
alternæ. Color albus, maculis flavescentibus. Apertura ovata, Labium
exterius crassum, intus dentatum. Interius dentato-glabrum.</p>

<p>Both <i>Triton! maculosus</i> and <i>Ranella candisata</i> approach the ideal portrait,
yet neither of them precisely agrees.</p>

<p>Under the name of <i>Trochus turritus</i> our author appears to have first
described his <i>Murex radula</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trochus</i> exumbilicatus, pyramidatus, anfractibus duplici serie muricatis.</p>

<p>Gualt, t. 58. f. F.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>Testa elongata, flavescens s. testacea. Anfractus 16, connexi sutura
crenulata, dorso duplici serie instructi punctis eminentibus pallidis. Apertura
subtetragona, subtus in canalis rudimentum desineus.</p>

<p>The <i>Murex Neritoideus</i> of the 'Systema' was thus described.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lyra Neritoides.</span> <i>L.</i> testa nodosa subrotunda.</p>

<p>Gualt.</p>

<p>Testa crassa, ponderosa, alba cum rubedine tincta, figura Neritæ, magnitudine
juglandis, cincta anfractibus  5 e nodis obtusis crassiusculis. Labium
interius depressum, longitudine pictum macula ferruginea.</p>

<h3>TROCHUS.</h3>

<p>Testa conica. Apertura quadrangularis, basi columella contorta, sinu
descendens.</p>

<p>The last five words had been substituted for "absque sinu evidente."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. maculatus.</span> <i>T.</i> contorto-umbilicatus conicus, vertice subnodoso.</p>

<p>The printed description and the synonymy are so very dissimilar to the
written one, that I entertain no doubt that an early definition of <i>T. Niloticus</i>
(with references to "Olear. Mus. t. 9. f. 5" and "Bonan. 3. f. 102")
was transmuted into that of a granular species, by the addition of "quasi
granis exasperata," &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. solaris</span> was not mentioned in the manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. perspectivus.</span> <i>T.</i> crenato-umbilicatus convexus obtusus: margine
acuto.</p>

<p>"Bonan. 3. f. 27, 28" was quoted, as illustrative: "costa crenata" not
"costa concava", was the earlier reading.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. hybridus.</span> <i>T.</i> crenato-umbilicatus, convexus, undique obtusus.</p>

<p>The proposed name was <i>T. spurius</i>. The "absque carina, rotundata"
was "absque angulis, glabra": "albo, flavoque" preceded "variegata".</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. Pharaonius.</span> <i>T.</i> umbilicatus subovatus striatus, punctis globulosis,
labio dentato.</p>

<p>"Habitat in mari rubro, frequens. D. Hasselquist." was written: the
final remark was absent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. Magus.</span> <i>T.</i> umbilicatus convexo-conicus nodosus.</p>

<p>The "cinereo nebulosa" was a manuscript emendation by Linnæus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. muricatus.</span> Except that "obverse" precedes "ovata", both the
diagnosis and the details are precisely similar to the printed account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. scaber.</span> <i>T.</i> umbilicatus subovatus, sulcis alternis majoribus moniliformibus.</p>

<p>The erroneous figure of d'Argenville was not cited in the original, nor,
indeed, was any name attached to the description. The whorls were said
to number from 6 to 8 (not 4 or 5); and the aperture was termed "ovata,"
not "subrotunda." "Pallida", the final remark, and the present construction
and enlargement of the passage relative to the inner lip (which at
first ran thus, "Labium posticum coadunatum, sinu postico excisum"),
had been added by Linnæus himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. labio.</span> <i>T.</i> exumbilicatus ovatus striato-tuberculatus, labio dentato.</p>

<p>The erroneous figure of d'Argenville was not cited; "variegata" was
the earlier reading of "marmorata"; "aliquot" of "et punctis"; "externo"
of "margine". Linnæus himself had enlarged the account of the
inner lip from the earlier "postice sinu excisum" to its present length.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. zizyphinus.</span> <i>T.</i> umbilicatus conicus, striis papillosis.</p>

<p>This is clearly not the imperforated <i>zizyphinus</i> of the 'Systema.' Gualtieri
was not referred to; "ambitu marginati", and "in aliis clausus", were not
in the copy: "columella parum obliqua" was an addition in the Linnean
handwriting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. telescopium.</span> <i>T.</i> exumbilicatus pyramidatus, striis exaratus; labio
postice recurvato, spirali, integro.</p>

<p>"Bon. 92", and "Klein 26. Pseudotrochus striatus", were the additional
synonyms of the MS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. dolabratus.</span> <i>T.</i> umbilicatus, labio postico recurvato sulcato, ovato-pyramidalis,
glaber.</p>

<p>The whorls were at first called imbricated. The "basis rotundata", and
"in superioribus vero unica", had been added by Linnæus.</p>

<h3>TURBO.</h3>

<p>Testa conica. Apertura orbicularis, integra.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. personatus.</span> <i>T.</i> exumbilicatus inermis convexus, labio postice
diducto.</p>

<p>The I of the reference to Rumphius was a misprint for the written 1. A
drawing of Gualtieri (t. 64. f. O), which accords not with the description
of this species, was an additional synonym. The name had been added
subsequently. <i>Turbo cidaris</i> agrees in most respects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. petholatus.</span> <i>T.</i> exumbilicatus ovatus lævis, anfractibus sursum
obsolete angulatis.</p>

<p>The written version furnishes us with the additional synonyms of "Gualt.
t. 64. f. F.", and "Klein 40. t. 2. f. 51."; the latter (also cited in the 'Systema')
was added by our author when he admitted the at first excluded 5.
6 of the synonym of Rumphius. The admission of the rounded-whorled
variety? was evidently an afterthought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. chrysostomus.</span> <i>T.</i> exumbilicatus subovatus rugosus striatus, spinis
fornicatis.</p>

<p>"Klein 41. t. 7. f. 126" (cited in the 'Systema'), and the printed "in
superiore serie majoribus", had been added by Linnæus in the original
account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. tectum-Persicum.</span> <i>T.</i> exumbilicatus subovatus, spinis obtusis
reflexis, subtus papillosus.</p>

<p>"Forte sola varietas sequentis a loco" has been remarked by our author,
who did not admit in his MS. the deceptive figure of d'Argenville.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. pagodus.</span> <i>T.</i> exumbilicatus conicus spinis obtusis concatenatis,
subtus papillose striatus.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>Neither "acuminata", nor the inappropriate "rotundata", were in the
original account of this well-known species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. calcar.</span> <i>T.</i> exumbilicatus depressus, anfractibus supra spinis fornicato-compressis
scabris.</p>

<p>To his printed synonyms Linnæus has added "Gualt. t. 65. f. N. P.",
"List. Hist. t. 608. f. 46", and "Klein t. 1. f. 27". The "fornicatis"
was an emendation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. marmoratus.</span> <i>T.</i> exumbilicatus subovatus nodosus lævis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. pica.</span> <i>T.</i> umbilicatus lævis conicus denticulo umbilicali.</p>

<p>"Habitat in Barbados, Jamaica", which corrects the stated locality of
the 'Systema,' and "Bonan. 29, 30", "Pet. Gaz. t. 70 f. 9", were the
additional particulars of the manuscript copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. argyrostomus.</span> <i>T.</i> umbilicatus subovatus, striatus lineis dorsalibus.</p>

<p>The erroneous references to Gualtieri and d'Argenville, were not present:
"os argenteum variegatum" was written after the reference to Rumphius,
which name belongs to figure 3, not to 4, whose colouring, moreover,  excludes
it from being illustrative. The intended specific name was "os
variegatum."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. margaritaceus.</span> <i>T.</i> exumbilicatus subovatus, (? angulo) dorsali
elevato, ore postice diducto.</p>

<p>Rumphius was not referred to in the original, where "subtilissimis"
was in the place of "variis": the printed "margine albo" was a subsequent
emendation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. delphinus.</span> <i>T.</i> umbilicatus depressus hispidus, spinis ramosis.</p>

<p>"Pet. Amb. t. 3. f. 1", and "Grew Mus. t. 11. f. 5, 6", were also cited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. distortus.</span> <i>T.</i> umbilicatus muricatus undique spinulis brevibus.</p>

<p>The final remark was not in the original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. scalaris.</span> <i>T.</i> cancellatus conicus, anfractibus distantibus.</p>

<p>"Pretium immensum, sæpe 100 ducatorum", was the final remark instead
of the printed one. "Pet. Amb. t. 2. f. 9", was an additional
synonym in the written version.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. clathrus.</span> <i>T.</i> cancellatus pyramidatus, anfractibus contiguis lævibus.</p>

<p>All the synonyms of the tenth edition of the 'Systema,' together with
"Johnst. t. 11. f. 9", were present in the MS., but most of them, together
with the final remark, had been subsequently added to the copy by our author.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. crenatus.</span> <i>T.</i> cancellatus pyramidatus, anfractibus contiguis supra
crenatis.</p>

<p>The details of the 'Museum' were referred to before their publication.
"Pyramidalis" was the earlier reading for "turrita"; "sæpe" was absent:
"transversim" preceded "crenati."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. uva.</span> <i>T.</i> cancellatus ovatus, anfractibus contiguis imbricatis.</p>

<p>"Pet. Gaz. t. 27. f. 2. Olivaris" was the unpublished additional synonym,
and the intended name was borrowed from that work. "Longitudinalibus"
was "transversis" in the copy, where "ut latus planum non
conspiciatur exterius distincta linea" terminated the account of the volutions:
the colouring ("alba") was not indicated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. corneus.</span> <i>T.</i> umbilicatus, anfractibus teretibus decussatim striatis,
oris margine reflexo.</p>

<p>The "s. cornea", the name, and the "vix manifeste" had been added to
the original account, which latter was referred to previous to its publication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. imbricatus.</span> <i>T.</i> pyramidalis, anfractibus deorsum subimbricatis.</p>

<p>The "præcedentibus tribus", here mentioned, were not those which the
species now follows, but nos. 358, 359, 360, after which it was placed in
the MS. "Grisea" had been added by Linnæus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. replicatus.</span> The entire account of this shell was interpolated in
the MS. by Linnæus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. acutangulus.</span> <i>T.</i> pyramidalis, sulco unico acuto majore.</p>

<p>The last four words of the details were written subsequently to the earlier
description, to which no name was then appended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. duplicatus.</span> <i>T.</i> pyramidalis, sulcis 2 acutis.</p>

<p>"Bonan. 3. f. 114", and "List. 160. t. 3. f. 7", were additional synonyms;
both, however, were quoted in the 'Systema.' The "color albus",
and the term "obtusiores", were in the Linnean handwriting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. terebra.</span> <i>T.</i> pyramidatus, sulcis 6 acutis.</p>

<p>"Bonan. 3. f. 115" was in the place of the doubtful figure of Rumphius;
the indicated colouring was simply "pallida": the "obsoletum" was an
afterthought.</p>

<h3>HELIX.</h3>

<p>Testa cochleata, lævis. Apertura subrotunda segmento circuli exempto.</p>

<p>Except <i>scarabæus</i> and <i>amarula</i>, the members of this genus were located
in the same group as in the published edition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. scarabæus.</span> <i>Morion</i> ovatus subanceps, labio utroque tridentato.</p>

<p>The "ovata, adeo" has replaced the earlier "ita", and "angulata" the
original "articulata". The account of the aperture was not inserted in the
manuscript, wherein "List. Hist. 577. f. 31" and "Klein 11. t. 1. f. 23",
had been inserted in the Linnean handwriting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. lapicida.</span> <i>H.</i> marginata perforata convexa carinata.</p>

<p>"Cincta" was a press emendation. The only written synonym was
"Faun. Suec. 1298".</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. oculus-capri.</span> <i>H.</i> marginata perforata subcarinata.</p>

<p>"Pet Gaz. t. 76. f. 6." was indicated as a synonym. The name was
Latinized from the "<i>l'&oelig;il de bouc</i>" of d'Argenville who has, however,
represented an utterly different shell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. carocolla.</span> <i>H.</i> submarginata imperforata carinata, labio interiore
recto.</p>

<p>D'Argenville's figure was, evidently, not at first considered sufficiently
illustrative to be referred to: it was not cited in the written copy. "Conicoplaniuscula"
was the reading for "convexa", "segmento circuli" (the
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> without any sequence was absurd) for "semiovata": the size, as usual,
was not given.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. cornu-militare.</span> <i>H.</i> marginata imperforata subcarinata, labio
interiore explanato.</p>

<p>The deceptive figure of Gualtieri was not at first cited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. cornea.</span> <i>H.</i> marginata convexa umbilicata, spira plana.</p>

<p>"Faun. Suec. 1304" was in place of the reference to 'Lister's English
Conchology,' a work apparently unknown to our author when he first drew
up the Museum Catalogue. I doubt the identity of this shell (the intended
name for which was <i>tabellaris</i>) with the cornea of the 'Systema.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. cornu-arietis.</span> <i>H.</i> utrinque depressa.</p>

<p>"List. Hist. t. 136. f. 40" was written by our author in the manuscript
copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. ampullacea.</span> <i>H.</i> subrotunda, sursum ventricosior glabra.</p>

<p>The original reading of "anfractus superne ventricosi" was "abdomen
superne ventricosius". The erroneous reference to Gaultieri was not at
first attached to the description. The species of the Museum was evidently
distinct from that of the 'Systema.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. glauca.</span> <i>H.</i> subrotunda acuminata, labro postice marginato.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. citrina.</span> <i>H.</i> umbilicata convexa obtusa.</p>

<p>The final remark was an afterthought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. arbustorum.</span> <i>H.</i> marginata perforata convexo-acuminata, ore suborbiculari,
margine duplici, antice elongato.</p>

<p>"Faun. Suec. 1295" was the only synonym; the work of Lister on
English Conchology not having been at first known to Linnæus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. ungulina.</span> <i>H.</i> marginata perforata spiralis convexa, ore suborbiculato.</p>

<p>The "Gualt." was a misprint for the written "Rumph."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. lutaria.</span> <i>H.</i> ovata-oblonga umbilicata, interne coloratiore.</p>

<p>"Habitat frequens in lutosis fluviis, lacubus." May not the <i>Valvata
piscinalis</i> be the shell intended?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. perversa.</span> <i>H.</i> ovato-oblonga subperforata glabra.</p>

<p>"Pet. Gaz. t. 44. f. 7", and "Grew. Mus. t. 10. f. 9" cited in the 'Systema',
were also referred to in the MS. "Alba", and "in quibusdam",
were interpolations in the Linnean handwriting: <i>H. sulphurata</i> was the
intended designation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. ianthina.</span> <i>H.</i> subrotunda obtusa patula diaphana.</p>

<p>The entire account of this beautiful shell was written by Linnæus subsequently
to the labours of his amanuensis: the twelve last printed words
were not present. The cited figure of Gualtieri was not admitted, as a representation,
but only alluded to in the final remark of "Confer Gualt.
t. 64. f. O." "List. Hist. t. 572. f. 23", and "Sloan. Jam. 2. p. 239. t. 1.
f. 4" were indicated as delineations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. nemoralis.</span> <i>H.</i></p>

<p>"Habitat ubique in Europæ nemoribus", and "Argen. t. 32. f. 8", were
the unprinted additions. Lister's English Conchology was not, of course,
mentioned. "Flavescens" and "nigro-purpurascens", were not in the
original.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. hæmastoma.</span> <i>H.</i> imperforata subrotunda fusca fascia longitudinali
subrecta alba, ore purpureo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. decollata.</span> <i>H.</i> elongata lævis truncato-mutilata.</p>

<p>"Pet. Gaz. t. 66. f. 1", and "Habitat in Arabia. Hasselquist. Santa
Cruz. Petiv." were the unprinted additions. The entire account was in the
handwriting of our author.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. amarula.</span> <i>Nerita</i> edentula oblonga, anfractibus multifariam denticulatis.</p>

<p>Our author was evidently puzzled as to the generic position of this peculiar-looking
shell, for he has written "Habitu accedit ad Volutas vespertiliones,
ore Helicibus, sed labium interius planum, et affinitas cum antecedenti
fiat, ut hic relinquatur." The preceding shell alluded to was <i>N.
corona</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. Neritoidea.</span> <i>H.</i> convexa longitudinaliter striata.</p>

<p>The erroneous reference to Gualtieri was not present in the written copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. perspicua.</span> <i>H.</i> convexo-ovata, labio interiore nullo, apertura ad
apicem usque pervia.</p>

<p>The then unpublished details of both this and the preceding were referred
to in the tenth edition of the 'Systema.' Patens was the proposed
specific appellation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. haliotoidea.</span> <i>H.</i> depresso-planiuscula obtusissima, ore ovali
dilatato.</p>

<p>None of the cited figures were at first accepted by our author, who only
added that of Rumphius to the earlier description, and wholly omitted the
rest. "Transverse" preceded "striata".</p>

<h3>NERITA.</h3>

<p>Testa subrotunda, obtusa. Labium interius planum, transversim truncatum,
depressum.</p>

<p>The generic arrangement was similar to that of the printed version.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. canrena.</span> <i>N.</i> edentula umbilicata, spira mucronata, labio reflexo
bifido.</p>

<p>When Linnæus first described this shell, under the appellation of <i>N.
musica</i>, he did not admit a single one of the cited figures as illustrative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. glaucina.</span> <i>N.</i> edentula convexa, umbilico simplici semiclauso gibboso
dicolore.</p>

<p>None of the deceptive figures were at first referred to, but had been
added at subsequent period; and that of Rumphius again erased. <i>N.
luteola</i> was the intended name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. albumen.</span> <i>N.</i> edentula subrotunda, umbilico teretinsculo.</p>

<p>The present heading agrees with the subsequent details, which could not
be affirmed of the printed one borrowed from the 'Systema.' The MS., in
some degree, clears up the extraordinary confusion in which the Linnean
species was enveloped. There were two <i>N. albumens</i> in the written copy.
The shell here described (assuredly not the lobed <i>albumen</i> of the 'Systema')
was originally termed <i>hepatica</i> or <i>luteola</i> (for both had been erased). The
true <i>albumen</i> was described as "edentula subrotunda, umbilico subcordato
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
labri interioris lobo explanato" and the only figure referred to was "Rumph.
t. 22. f. B." "Klein 13. Platystoma vitellum compressum" was also
mentioned. This description was suppressed, and the other species retained,
with the erroneous designation, and the faulty synonymy, attached. Nor
was this the only change. In order to include the <i>Natica vitellus</i> of authors
("Rumph. t. 22. f. A. Valvata lævis prima s. vitellus" had been quoted
by our author) the "aut lutea", "aut maculis albis", had been added to
the earlier description: so, likewise, had been "Apertura rotundata, semicordata",
and "glabrum, planiusculum, nitidum." I suspect, then, that whilst
the ideal of the <i>albumen</i> of the 'Systema' was any hemispherical or flattened
<i>Natica</i> with a labial lobe (such as <i>Nat. albumen</i>, <i>didyma</i>, <i>olla</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>), the
<i>albumen</i> of the 'Museum', as printed, was composed of <i>Natica rufa</i>
("Rumph. 22. f. D." was quoted in the MS.) and <i>vitellus</i> (for A, not B, of
Rumphius was the letter indicated in the MS.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. mammilla.</span> The entire account of this common shell was added in
the Linnean handwriting. The inappropriate "aut lutea" was not at first
present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. corona.</span> <i>N.</i> edentula, simplici spira spinosa.</p>

<p>"Pet. Amb. t. 3. f. 4.", a mere copy of the Rumphian figure, was also
quoted. The 19 in the reference to d'Argenville was a misprint for the
written 10. <i>N. spinosa</i> was the intended designation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. radula.</span> <i>N.</i> edentula sulcata, tuberculis æqualibus.</p>

<p>The valvata granulata of Rumphius (t. 22. f. M.) was referred to at illustrative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. cornea.</span> <i>N.</i> edentula, obsolete striata.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. bidens.</span>  <i>N.</i></p>

<p>"Obsoletis" followed "duobus": the name had been written subsequent
to the description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. reticulata.</span> <i>P.</i> conica compressa, superficie reticulata.</p>

<p>The suggestion I have elsewhere made that this uncertain shell might
prove the European <i>Pedicularia</i>, induces me to remark that, although <i>P.
Sicula</i> has been supposed to be a comparatively modern discovery, Favanne
had long ago delineated it in the fourth plate (f. H. 1.) of his enlarged
edition of d'Argenville.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. nimbosa.</span> <i>P.</i> conica ovalis, costis confertis, vertice perforato.</p>

<p>The discrepancy between the heading borrowed from the 'Systema', and
the after details, is removed by the substitution of the original one. The
shell was termed <i>perforata</i> (not <i>nimbosa</i>), and was wrongly identified by
Linnæus with the striated brown <i>Fissurella</i> of the 'Systema'.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In addition to the printed species, the two following were present in the
manuscript copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. solaris.</span> <i>P.</i> ovata integerrima, striis subnodosis, vertice acutiusculo.</p>

<p>Testa ovata, diaphana, magnitudine extimi articuli digiti, margine integerrimo,
lævis, striis subtilissimis inæqualibus numerosissimis, fasciis longitudinalibus
rubris albo passim maculatis. Mucro acutiusculus obliquus
albidus.</p>

<p>This was placed in the section having a simple margin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. perfoliata.</span> <i>P.</i> conica, reclinata, perfoliata.</p>

<p>Testa magnitudine coryli nucis, conica, sed cono retro inclinato, acutissima,
alba, imbricata lamellis horizontaliter testam cingentibus. Margo
integer, ovalis, antrorsum gibbus s. dilatatus. Cavitas profunde glabra.</p>

<p>This description very fairly suits the <i>Patella antiquata</i> of the twelfth
edition of the 'Systema'.</p>

<h3>DENTALIUM.</h3>

<p>Testa univalvis, subcylindrica, utrinque aperta. Spira regularis nulla.</p>

<p>Although the <i>Serpulæ</i> were intermingled, it is clear that they did not
accord with the above definition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. elephantinum.</span> <i>D.</i> subulatum subarcuatum, angulatum.</p>

<p>The synonymy of the tenth edition was appended, Lister excepted; the
erroneous 13 of the reference to the Gazophylaceum was erased. <i>Dens
elephantis</i> was the proposed trivial name.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. entalis.</span> <i>D.</i> subulato-cylindricum, subarcuatum.</p>

<p>The terminal details were not furnished.</p>

<p><i>D. dentalium</i> was the intended appellation.</p>

<h3>SERPULA.</h3>

<p>In the original version of the 'Museum Ulricæ,' the members of this
genus are not separated from the <i>Dentalia</i> (a proof, among many others,
of the early date of this catalogue). Linnæus, however, when revising
the transcript, had meditated the withdrawing of <i>S. arenaria</i> and <i>lumbricalis</i>,
and constituted for them a nameless genus with the following
definition:&mdash;</p>

<p>Testa tubulosa, isthmis concamerata, dissepimentis integris, nec perforatis,
s. communicantibus.</p>

<p>This genus would have been the equivalent of the modern <i>Vermetus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. triquetra.</span> <i>D.</i> triquetrum, adhærens.</p>

<p>The reference to Gualtieri (whose figure was somewhat uncertain, yet
probably designed for <i>Vermilia triquetra</i>) was queried. The proposed
name was <i>D. parasiticum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. contortuplicata.</span> <i>D.</i> teretiusculum, depressum, rugosum.</p>

<p>There was at first no name to the description of this shell; but it was
added in the handwriting of Linnæus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. glomerata.</span> <i>D.</i> teres glomeratum.</p>

<p>The 'decussato-rugosa' of the 'Systema', applicable to the <i>'Vermetus
subcancellatus</i>', the shell designed in that work, was not inserted. Gualtieri's
figure is that of <i>Vermetus glomeratus</i>, for the colouring of which 'alba'
would be a most inappropriate term.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. lumbricalis.</span> <i>D.</i> spira divaricata teretiusculum, integrum.</p>

<p>D'Arg. t. 29. f. 1. was an additional synonym.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. arenaria.</span> <i>D.</i> teres rectiusculum intestiniforme.</p>

<p>Despite the name borrowed from Rumphius, the <i>Vermetus gigas</i> was the
object defined in the tenth edition of the 'Systema'. The absence from
the manuscript of the reference to Gualtieri's drawing of that shell, and
"rectiusculum" in the written diagnosis, confirms the conclusion previously
arrived at, that the <i>Septaria arenaria</i> of authors was the species
intended in the 'Museum Ulricæ': it was subsequently termed <i>S. polythalamia</i>
by Linnæus. The delusive "subangulata" of the supposititious
diagnosis was of course absent.</p>

<p>The <i>V. gigas</i> was probably intended by the following unpublished description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. intestiniforme.</span> <i>D.</i> teres flexuosum intestiniforme.</p>

<p>Testa rudis crassitie digiti et ultro, flexuosa vario modo in diversis, integra,
intus lævis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. anguina.</span></p>

<p>The two very dissimilar <i>Siliquariæ</i> united under this appellation in the
'Museum Ulricæ,' were originally held distinct. The prickly variety was
the unpublished type, and was thus defined:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. anguinum.</span> <i>D.</i> spira inæquali angulata aculeata, sulco longitudinali
perforata.</p>

<p>Rumph. 125. t. 41. f. H. Solen anguinus.</p>

<p>Lang. Test. 6. Tubulus vermicularis crista dentata.</p>

<p>Testa albida, teretiuscula, angulis 9 obsoletis. Anfractus inæquales,
nunc confertiores, nunc remotiores. Sulcus longitudinalis in superiore
latere perforatus serie punctorum. Spinæ breves, fornicatæ ad angulos
in latere inferiore.</p>

<p>Condensation, that peculiar faculty of the mental organization of Linnæus,
induced him to suppress this description, and attach the species, as
a variety, to the form he had simultaneously characterized as
<i>D.</i> spira elongata, teretiusculum, inerme, fissura longitudinali.
Gualt. test. 10. f. z.</p>

<p>To this latter the published details belong, except the expression "passim
concatenata et quasi poris pertusa" (which was a subsequent and fallacious
addition), and the account of the variety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. penis.</span> <i>D.</i> teres, extremitate radiata disco cylindris poroso.</p>

<p>"Bonan. i. f. 38.", indicated in the tenth edition of the 'Systema', was
among the synonyms. The "Stigma, &amp;c." was an addition; so too were
"lævis," "tubulosis", and "æqualibus".  The term "hemisphærico" has
replaced the earlier "convexo."</p>

<p>In addition to the published species, the <i>S. Spirorbis</i> of the 'Systema'
appears to have been indicated as</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. planorbe.</span> <i>D.</i> spira plana, adhærens.</p>

<p>It. W. Goth. 170. Dentalium testa spirali plana adhærente.</p>

<p>Planc. Conch. 13. n. 3. Vermiculus in littore Veneto foliis algæ adhærens.</p>

<p>Testa minima, magnitudine nuper ab ovo exclusæ cochleæ, cujus formam
omnino gerit, at plana omnino est, et altero latere omnino fuci foliis adhæret.</p>

<p>This was evidently different from the <i>Serpula planorbis</i> of the 'Systema.'</p>

<h2 id="ON_THE_ZOOLOGICAL_GEOGRAPHY" class="chapt">On the Zoological Geography of the Malay Archipelago. By
<span class="smcap">Alfred R. Wallace</span>, Esq. Communicated by <span class="smcap">Charles
Darwin</span>, Esq., F.R.S. &amp; L.S.</h2>

<p class="center">[Read Nov. 3rd, 1859.]</p>

<p>In Mr. Sclater's paper on the Geographical Distribution of Birds,
read before the Linnean Society, and published in the 'Proceedings'
for February 1858, he has pointed out that the western
islands of the Archipelago belong to the Indian, and the eastern
to the Australian region of Ornithology. My researches in these
countries lead me to believe that the same division will hold good
in every branch of Zoology; and the object of my present communication
is to mark out the precise limits of each region, and
to call attention to some inferences of great general importance as
regards the study of the laws of organic distribution.</p>

<p>The Australian and Indian regions of Zoology are very strongly
contrasted. In one the Marsupial order constitutes the great mass
of the mammalia,&mdash;in the other not a solitary marsupial animal
exists. Marsupials of at least two genera (<i>Cuscus</i> and <i>Belideus</i>)
are found all over the Moluccas and in Celebes; but none have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
been detected in the adjacent islands of Java and Borneo. Of all
the varied forms of <i>Quadrumana</i>, <i>Carnivora</i>, <i>Insectivora</i> and <i>Ruminantia</i>
which abound in the western half of the Archipelago, the
only genera found in the Moluccas are <i>Paradoxurus</i> and <i>Cervus</i>.
The <i>Sciuridæ</i>, so numerous in the western islands, are represented
in Celebes by only two or three species, while not one is found
further east. Birds furnish equally remarkable illustrations. The
Australian region is the richest in the world in Parrots; the
Asiatic is (of tropical regions) the poorest. Three entire families
of the Psittacine order are peculiar to the former region, and two
of them, the Cockatoos and the Lories, extend up to its extreme
limits, without a solitary species passing into the Indian islands of
the Archipelago. The genus <i>Pal&oelig;ornis</i> is, on the other hand, confined
with equal strictness to the Indian region. In the Rasorial
order, the <i>Phasianidæ</i> are Indian, the <i>Megapodiidæ</i> Australian; but
in this case one species of each family just passes the limits into
the adjacent region. The genus <i>Tropidorhynchus</i>, highly characteristic
of the Australian region, and everywhere abundant as well
in the Moluccas and New Guinea as in Australia, is quite unknown
in Java and Borneo. On the other hand, the entire families
of <i>Bucconidæ</i>, <i>Trogonidæ</i> and <i>Phyllornithidæ</i>, and the genera <i>Pericrocotus</i>,
<i>Picnonotus</i>, <i>Trichophorus</i>, <i>Ixos</i>, in fact, almost all the
vast family of Thrushes and a host of other genera, cease abruptly
at the eastern side of Borneo, Java, and Bali. All these groups
are <i>common birds</i> in the great Indian islands; they abound everywhere;
they are the characteristic features of the ornithology; and
it is most striking to a naturalist, on passing the narrow straits of
Macassar and Lombock, suddenly to miss them entirely, together
with the <i>Quadrumana</i> and <i>Felidæ</i>, the <i>Insectivora</i> and <i>Rodentia</i>,
whose varied species people the forests of Sumatra, Java, and
Borneo.</p>

<p>To define exactly the limits of the two regions where they are
(geographically) most intimately connected, I may mention that during
a few days' stay in the island of Bali I found birds of the genera
<i>Copsychus</i>, <i>Megalaima</i>, <i>Tiga</i>, <i>Ploceus</i>, and <i>Sturnopastor</i>, all characteristic
of the Indian region and abundant in Malacca, Java, and
Borneo; while on crossing over to Lombock, during three months
collecting there, not one of them was ever seen; neither have they
occurred in Celebes nor in any of the more eastern islands I have
visited. Taking this in connexion with the fact of <i>Cacatua</i>, <i>Tropidorhynchus</i>,
and <i>Megapodius</i> having their western limit in Lombock,
we may consider it established that the Strait of Lombock
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
(only 15 miles wide) marks the limits and abruptly separates two
of the great Zoological regions of the globe. The Philippine
Islands are in some respects of doubtful location, resembling and
differing from both regions. They are deficient in the varied
Mammals of Borneo, but they contain no Marsupials. The Psittaci
are scarce, as in the Indian region; the Lories are altogether absent,
but there is one representative of the Cockatoos. Woodpeckers,
Trogons, and the genera <i>Ixos</i>, <i>Copsychus</i>, and <i>Ploceus</i> are highly
characteristic of India. <i>Tanysiptera</i> and <i>Megapodius</i>, again, are
Australian forms, but these seem represented by only solitary
species. The islands possess also a few peculiar genera. We
must on the whole place the Philippine Islands in the Indian region,
but with the remark that they are deficient in some of its most
striking features. They possess several isolated forms of the Australian
region, but by no means sufficient to constitute a real
transition thereto.</p>

<p>Leaving the Philippines out of the question for the present, the
western and eastern islands of the Archipelago, as here divided,
belong to regions more distinct and contrasted than any other of the
great zoological divisions of the globe. South America and Africa,
separated by the Atlantic, do not differ so widely as Asia and
Australia; Asia with its abundance and variety of large Mammals
and no Marsupials, and Australia with scarcely anything but
Marsupials; Asia with its gorgeous <i>Phasianidæ</i>, Australia with
its dull-coloured <i>Megapodiidæ</i>; Asia the poorest tropical region
in Parrots, Australia the richest; and all these striking characteristics
are almost unimpaired at the very limits of their respective
districts; so that in a few hours we may experience an amount of
zoological difference which only weeks or even months of travel
will give us in any other part of the world!</p>

<p>Moreover there is nothing in the aspect or physical character of
the islands to lead us to expect such a difference; their physical
and geological differences do not coincide with the zoological
differences. There is a striking homogeneity in the <span class="smcap">TWO</span> <i>halves</i>
of the Archipelago. The great volcanic chain runs through both
parts; Borneo is the counterpart of New Guinea; the Philippines
closely resemble the equally fertile and equally volcanic
Moluccas; while in eastern Java begins to be felt the more arid
climate of Timor and Australia. But these resemblances are
accompanied by an extreme zoological diversity, the Asiatic and
Australian regions finding in Borneo and New Guinea respectively
their highest development.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

<p>But it may be said: "The separation between these two regions
is not so absolute. There <i>is</i> some transition. There <i>are</i> species
and genera common to the eastern and western islands." This is
true, yet (in my opinion) proves no transition in the proper sense
of the word; and the nature and amount of the resemblance only
shows more strongly the absolute and original distinctness of the
two divisions. The exception here clearly proves the rule.</p>

<p>Let us investigate these cases of supposed transition. In the
western islands almost the only instance of a group peculiar to
Australia and the eastern islands is the <i>Megapodius</i> in North-west
Borneo. Not one of the Australian forms of Mammalia
passes the limits of the region. On the other hand, Quadrumana
occur in Celebes, Batchian, Lombock, and perhaps Timor; Deer
have reached Celebes, Timor, Buru, Ceram, and Gilolo, but not
New Guinea; Pigs have extended to New Guinea, probably the
true eastern limit of the genus <i>Sus</i>; Squirrels are found in
Celebes, Lombock, and Sumbawa: among birds, <i>Gallus</i> occurs in
Celebes and Sumbawa, Woodpeckers reach Celebes, and Hornbills
extend to the North-west of New Guinea. These cases of
identity or resemblance in the animals of the two regions we may
group into three classes; 1st, identical species; 2nd, closely
allied or representative species; and 3rd, species of peculiar and
isolated genera. The common Grey Monkey (<i>Macacus cynomolgus</i>)
has reached Lombock, and perhaps Timor, but not Celebes. The
Deer of the Moluccas seems to be a variety of the <i>Cervus rufus</i> of
Java and Borneo. The Jungle Cock of Celebes and Lombock is a
Javanese species.  <i>Hirundo javanica</i>, <i>Zosterops flavus</i>, <i>Halcyon
collaris</i>, <i>Eurystomus gularis</i>, <i>Macropygia phasianella</i>, <i>Merops javanicus</i>,
<i>Anthreptes lepida</i>, <i>Ptilonopus melanocephala</i>, and some other
birds appear the same in the adjacent islands of the eastern and
western divisions, and some of them range over the whole Archipelago.
But after reading Lyell on the various modes of dispersion
of animals, and looking at the proximity of the islands, we
shall feel astonished, not at such an amount of interchange of
species (most of which are birds of great powers of flight), but
rather that in the course of ages a much greater and almost complete
fusion has not taken place. Were the Atlantic gradually to
narrow till only a strait of twenty miles separated Africa from
South America, can we help believing that many birds and insects
and some few mammals would soon be interchanged? But such
interchange would be a fortuitous mixture of faunas essentially
and absolutely dissimilar, not a natural and regular transition from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
one to the other. In like manner the cases of identical species
in the eastern and western islands of the Archipelago are due to
the gradual and accidental commingling of originally absolutely
distinct faunas.</p>

<p>In our second class (representative species) we must place the Wild
Pigs, which seem to be of distinct but closely allied species in each
island; the Squirrels also of Celebes are of peculiar species, as are
the Woodpeckers and Hornbills, and two Celebes birds of the
Asiatic genera <i>Phænicophæus</i> and <i>Acridotheres</i>. Now these and
a few more of like character are closely allied to other species inhabiting
Java, Borneo, or the Philippines. We have only therefore
to suppose that the species of the western passed over to the
eastern islands at so remote a period as on one side or the other
to have become extinct, and to have been replaced by an allied
form, and we shall have produced exactly the state of things now
existing. Such extinction and such replacement we know has
been continually going on. Such has been the regular course of
nature for countless ages in every part of the earth of which we
have geological records; and unless we <i>are</i> prepared to show that
the Indo-Australian Archipelago was an altogether exceptional
region, such must have been the course of nature here also. If
these islands have existed in their present form only during one
of the later divisions of the Tertiary period, and if interchange of
species at very rare and distant intervals has occurred, then the
fact of some identical and other closely allied species is a necessary
result, even if the two regions in question had been originally
peopled by absolutely distinct creations of organic beings, and
there had never been any closer connexion between them than
<i>now</i> exists. The occurrence of a limited number of representative
species in the two divisions of the Archipelago does not therefore
prove any true transition from one to the other.</p>

<p>The examples of our third class&mdash;of peculiar genera having little
or no affinity with those of the adjacent islands&mdash;are almost entirely
confined to Celebes, and render that island a district <i>per se</i>, in the
highest degree interesting. <i>Cynopithecus</i>, a genus of Baboons, the
extraordinary Babirusa and the singular ruminant <i>Ansa depressicornis</i>
have nothing in common with Asiatic mammals, but seem
more allied to those of Africa. A quadrumanous animal of the
same genus (perhaps identical) occurs in the little island of Batchian,
which forms the extreme eastern limit of the highest order
of mammalia. An allied species is also said to exist in the Philippines.
Now this occurrence of quadrumana in the Australian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
region proves nothing whatever as regards a transition to the
western islands, which, among their numerous monkeys and apes,
have nothing at all resembling them. The species of Celebes and
Batchian have the high superorbital ridge, the long nasal bone,
the dog-like figure, the minute erect tail, the predaceous habits and
the fearless disposition of the true Baboons, and find their allies
nowhere nearer than in tropical Africa. The <i>Anoa</i> seems also to
point towards the same region, so rich in varied forms of Antelopes.</p>

<p>In the class of birds, Celebes possesses a peculiar genus of Parrots
(<i>Prioniturus</i>), said to occur also in the Philippines; <i>Meropogon</i>,
intermediate between an Indian and an African form of Bee-eaters;
and the anomalous <i>Scissirostrum</i>, which Prince Bonaparte places
next to a Madagascar bird, and forms a distinct subfamily for the
reception of the two. Celebes also contains a species of <i>Coracias</i>,
which is here quite out of its normal area, the genus being otherwise
confined to Africa and continental India, not occurring in
any other part of the Archipelago. The Celebes bird is placed, in
Bonaparte's 'Conspectus,' between two African species, to which
therefore I presume it is more nearly allied than to those of India.
Having just received Mr. Smith's Catalogue of the Hymenoptera
collected during my first residence in Celebes, I find in it some
facts of an equally singular nature. Of 103 species, only 16 are
known to inhabit any of the western islands of the Archipelago,
while 18 are identical with species of continental India, China,
and the Philippine Islands, two are stated to be identical with
insects hitherto known only from tropical Africa, and another is
said to be most closely allied to one from the Cape.</p>

<p>These phenomena of distribution are, I believe, the most anomalous
yet known, and in fact altogether unique. I am aware of no
other spot upon the earth which contains a number of species, in
several distinct classes of animals, the nearest allies to which do
not exist in any of the countries which on every side surround it,
but which are to be found only in another primary division of the
globe, separated from them all by a vast expanse of ocean. In no
other case are the species of a genus or the genera of a family distributed
in <i>two</i> distinct areas separated by countries in which they
do not exist; so that it has come to be considered a law in geographical
distribution, "that both species and groups inhabit continuous
areas."</p>

<p>Facts such as these can only be explained by a bold acceptance
of vast changes in the surface of the earth. They teach us that
this island of Celebes is more ancient than most of the islands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
now surrounding it, and obtained some part of its fauna before
they came into existence. They point to the time when a great
continent occupied a portion at least of what is now the Indian
Ocean, of which the islands of Mauritius, Bourbon, &amp;c. may be
fragments, while the Chagos Bank and the Keeling Atolls indicate
its former extension eastward to the vicinity of what is now the
Malayan Archipelago. The Celebes group remains the last eastern
fragment of this now submerged land, or of some of its adjacent
islands, indicating its peculiar origin by its zoological isolation,
and by still retaining a marked affinity with the African fauna.</p>

<p>The great Pacific continent, of which Australia and New Guinea
are no doubt fragments, probably existed at a much earlier period,
and extended as far westward as the Moluccas. The extension of
Asia as far to the south and east as the Straits of Macassar and
Lombock must have occurred subsequent to the submergence of
both these great southern continents; and the breaking up and
separation of the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo has been
the last great geological change these regions have undergone.
That this has really taken place as here indicated, we think is
proved by the following considerations. Not more than twenty
(probably a smaller number) out of about one hundred land birds
of Celebes at present known are found in Java or Borneo, and
only one or two of twelve or fifteen Mammalia. Of the Mammalia
and birds of Borneo, however, at least three-fourths, probably
five-sixths, inhabit also Java, Sumatra, or the peninsula of Malacca.
Now, looking at the direction of the Macassar Straits running nearly
north and south, and remembering we are in the district of the
monsoons, a steady south-east and north-west wind blowing alternately
for about six months each, we shall at once see that Celebes
is more favourably situated than any other island to receive stray
passengers from Borneo, whether drifted across the sea or wafted
through the air. The distance too is less than between any of the
other large islands; there are no violent currents to neutralize
the action of the winds; and numerous islets in mid-channel offer
stations which might rescue many of the wanderers, and admit,
after repose, of fresh migrations. Between Java and Borneo the
width of sea is much greater, the intermediate islands are fewer,
and the direction of the monsoons <i>along</i> and not <i>across</i> the Java
sea, accompanied by alternating currents in the same direction,
must render accidental communication between the two islands
exceedingly difficult; so that where the facilities for intercommunication
are greatest, the number of species common to the two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
countries is least, and <i>vice versá</i>. But again, the mass of the
species of Borneo, Java, &amp;c., even when not <i>identical</i> are <i>congeneric</i>,
which, as before explained, indicates <i>identity</i> at an earlier epoch;
whereas the great mass of the fauna of Celebes is widely different
from that of the western islands, consisting mostly of genera, and
even of entire families, altogether foreign to them. This clearly
points to a former total diversity of forms and species,&mdash;existing
similarities being the result of intermixture, the extreme facilities
for which we have pointed out. In the case of the great western
islands a former more complete identity is indicated, the present
differences having arisen from their isolation during a considerable
period, allowing time for that partial extinction and introduction
of species which is the regular course of nature. If the very small
number of western species in Celebes is all that the most favourable
conditions for transmission could bring about, the complete
similarity of the faunas of the western islands could never (with
far less favourable conditions) have been produced by the same
means. And what other means can we conceive but the former
connexion of those islands with each other and with the continent
of Asia?</p>

<p>In striking confirmation of this view we have physical evidence
of a very interesting nature. These countries are in fact <i>still
connected</i>, and that so completely that an elevation of only 300
feet would nearly double the extent of tropical Asia. Over
the whole of the Java Sea, the Straits of Malacca, the Gulf of
Siam, and the southern part of the China Sea, ships can anchor in
less than fifty fathoms. A vast submarine plain unites together
the apparently disjointed parts of the Indian zoological region, and
abruptly terminates, exactly at its limits, in an unfathomable ocean.
The deep sea of the Moluccas comes up to the very coasts of
Northern Borneo, to the Strait of Lombock in the south, and to
near the middle of the Strait of Macassar. May we not therefore
from these facts very fairly conclude that, according to the system
of alternate bands of elevation and depression that seems very
generally to prevail, the last great rising movement of the volcanic
range of Java and Sumatra was accompanied by the depression
that now separates them from Borneo and from the continent?</p>

<p>It it worthy of remark that the various islands of the Moluccas,
though generally divided by a less extent of sea, have fewer species
in common; but the separating seas are in almost every case of
immense depth, indicating that the separation took place at a much
earlier period. The same principle is well illustrated by the distribution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
of the genus <i>Paradisea</i>, two species of which (the common
Birds of Paradise) are found only in New Guinea and the
islands of Aru, Mysol, Waigiou, and Jobie, all of which are connected
with New Guinea by banks of soundings, while they do
not extend to Ceram or the Ké Islands, which are no further from
New Guinea, but are separated from it by deep sea. Again, the
chain of small volcanic islands to the west of Gilolo, though divided
by channels of only ten or fifteen miles wide, possess many distinct
representative species of insects, and even, in some cases, of birds
also. The Baboons of Batchian have not passed to Gilolo, a much
larger island, only separated from it by a channel ten miles wide,
and in one part almost blocked up with small islands.</p>

<p>Now looking at these phenomena of distribution, and especially
at those presented by the fauna of Celebes, it appears to me that
a much exaggerated effect, in producing the present distribution
of animals, has been imputed to the accidental transmission of
individuals across intervening seas; for we have here as it were
a test or standard by which we may measure the possible effect
due to these causes, and we find that, under conditions perhaps the
most favourable that exist on the globe, the percentage of species
derived from this source is extremely small. When my researches
in the Archipelago are completed, I hope to be able to determine
with some accuracy this numerical proportion in several cases; but
in the mean time we will consider 20 per cent. as the probable
maximum for birds and mammals which in Celebes have been
derived from Borneo or Java.</p>

<p>Let us now apply this standard to the case of Great Britain and
the Continent, in which the width of dividing sea and the extent
of opposing coasts are nearly the same, but in which the species
are almost all identical,&mdash;or to Ireland, more than 90 per cent.
of whose species are British,&mdash;and we shall at once see that no
theory of transmission across the present Straits is admissible, and
shall be compelled to resort to the idea of a very recent separation
(long since admitted), to account for these zoological phenomena.</p>

<p>It is, however, to the oceanic islands that we consider the application
of this test of the most importance. Let any one try to
realize the comparative facilities for the transmission of organized
beings across the Strait of Macassar from Borneo to Celebes, and
from South Europe or North Africa to the island of Madeira, at
least four times the distance, and a mere point in the ocean, and
he would probably consider that in a given period a hundred cases
of transmission would be more likely to occur in the former case
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
than one in the latter. Yet of the comparatively rich insect-fauna
of Madeira, 40 per cent. are continental species; and of the flowering
plants more than 60 per cent. The Canary Islands offer
nearly similar results. Nothing but a former connexion with the
Continent will explain such an amount of specific identity (the
weight of which will be very much increased if we take into account
the representative species); and the direction of the Atlas range
towards Teneriffe, and of the Sierra Nevada towards Madeira, are
material indications of such a connexion.</p>

<p>The Galapagos are no further from South America than Madeira
is from Europe, and, being of greater extent, are far more
liable to receive chance immigrants; yet they have hardly a species
identical with any inhabiting the American continent. These
islands therefore may well have originated in mid-ocean; or if
they ever were connected with the mainland, it was at so distant
a period that the natural extinction and renewal of species has left
not one in common. The character of their fauna, however, is more
what we should expect to arise from the chance introduction of a
very few species at distant intervals; it is very poor; it contains
but few genera, and those scattered among unconnected families;
its genera often contain several closely allied species, indicating
a single antitype.</p>

<p>The fauna and flora of Madeira and of the Canaries, on the other
hand, have none of this chance character. They are comparatively
rich in genera and species; most of the principal groups and
families are more or less represented; and, in fact, these islands do
not differ materially, as to the general character of their animal and
vegetable productions, from any isolated mountain in Europe or
North Africa of about equal extent.</p>

<p>On exactly the same principles, the very large number of species
of plants, insects, and birds, in Europe and North America, either
absolutely identical or represented by very closely allied species,
most assuredly indicates that some means of land communication
in temperate or sub-arctic latitudes existed at no very distant geological
epoch; and though many naturalists are inclined to regard
all such views as vague and unprofitable speculations, we are
convinced they will soon take their place among the legitimate
deductions of science.</p>

<p>Geology can detect but a portion of the changes the surface of
the earth has undergone. It can reveal the past history and mutations
of what is now dry land; but the ocean tells nothing of her
bygone history. Zoology and Botany here come to the aid of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
their sister science, and by means of the humble weeds and despised
insects inhabiting its now distant shores, can discover some
of those past changes which the ocean itself refuses to reveal.
They can indicate, approximately at least, where and at what
period former continents must have existed, from what countries
islands must have been separated, and at how distant an epoch the
rupture took place. By the invaluable indications which Mr.
Darwin has deduced from the structure of coral reefs, by the
surveys of the ocean-bed now in progress, and by a more extensive
and detailed knowledge of the geographical distribution of animals
and plants, the naturalist may soon hope to obtain some idea of
the continents which have now disappeared beneath the ocean,
and of the general distribution of land and sea at former geological
epochs.</p>

<p>Most writers on geographical distribution have completely overlooked
its connexion with well-established geological facts, and
have thereby created difficulties where none exist. The peculiar
and apparently endemic faunæ and floræ of the oceanic islands
(such as the Galapagos and St. Helena) have been dwelt upon as
something anomalous and inexplicable. It has been imagined that
the more simple condition of such islands would be to have their
productions identical with those of the nearest land, and that their
actual condition is an incomprehensible mystery. The very reverse
of this is however the case. We really require no speculative
hypothesis, no new theory, to explain these phenomena; they
are the logical results of well-known laws of nature. The regular
and unceasing extinction of species, and their replacement by allied
forms, is now no hypothesis, but an established fact; and it necessarily
produces such peculiar faunæ and floræ in all but recently
formed or newly disrupted islands, subject of course to more or
less modification according to the facilities for the transmission of
fresh species from adjacent continents. Such phenomena therefore
are far from uncommon. Madagascar, Mauritius, the Moluccas,
New Zealand, New Caledonia, the Pacific Islands, Juan Fernandez,
the West India Islands, and many others, all present such
peculiarities in greater or less development. It is the instances
of identity of species in distant countries that presents the real
difficulty. What was supposed to be the more normal state of
things is really exceptional, and requires some hypothesis for its
explanation. The phenomena of distribution in the Malay Archipelago,
to which I have here called attention, teach us that, however
narrow may be the strait separating an island from its continent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
it is still an impassable barrier against the passage of any
considerable number and variety of land animals; and that in all
cases in which such islands possess a tolerably rich and varied
fauna of species mostly identical, or closely allied with those of
the adjacent country, we are forced to the conclusion that a geologically
recent disruption has taken place. Great Britain, Ireland,
Sicily, Sumatra, Java and Borneo, the Aru Islands, the
Canaries and Madeira, are cases to which the reasoning is fully
applicable.</p>

<p>In his introductory Essay on the Flora of New Zealand, Dr.
Hooker has most convincingly applied this principle to show the
former connexion of New Zealand and other southern islands with
the southern extremity of America; and I will take this opportunity
of calling the attention of zoologists to the very satisfactory manner
in which this view clears away many difficulties in the distribution
of animals. The most obvious of these is the occurrence
of Marsupials in America only, beyond the Australian region.
They evidently entered by the same route as the plants of New
Zealand and Tasmania which occur in South temperate America,
but having greater powers of dispersion, a greater plasticity of
organization, have extended themselves over the whole continent
though with so few modifications of form and structure as to point
to a unity of origin at a comparatively recent period. It is among
insects, however, that the resemblances approach in number and
degree to those exhibited by plants. Among Butterflies the beautiful
<i>Heliconidæ</i> are strictly confined to South America, with the
exception of a single genus (<i>Hamadryas</i>) found in the Australian
region from New Zealand to New Guinea. In Coleoptera many
families and genera are characteristic of the two countries; such
are <i>Pseudomorphidæ</i> among the Geodephaga, <i>Lamprimidæ</i> and
<i>Syndesidæ</i> among the Lucani, <i>Anoplognathidæ</i> among the Lamellicornes,
<i>Stigmoderidæ</i> among the Buprestes, <i>Natalis</i> among the
Cleridæ, besides a great number of representative genera. This
peculiar distribution has hitherto only excited astonishment, and
has confounded all ideas of unity in the distribution of organic
beings; but we now see that they are in exact accordance with the
phenomena presented by the flora of the same regions, as developed
in the greatest detail by the researches of Dr. Hooker.</p>

<p>It is somewhat singular, however, that not one <i>identical species</i>
of insect should yet have been discovered, while no less than 89
species of flowering plants are found both in New Zealand and
South America. The relations of the animals and of the plants
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
of these countries must necessarily depend on the same physical
changes which the Southern hemisphere has undergone; and we
are therefore led to conclude that insects are much less persistent
in their specific forms than flowering plants, while among Mammalia
and land birds (in which no genus even is common to the
countries in question) species must die and be replaced much more
rapidly than in either. And this is exactly in accordance with the
fact (well established by geology) that at a time when the shells
of the European seas were almost all identical with species now
living, the European Mammalia were almost all different. The
duration of life of species would seem to be in an inverse proportion
to their complexity of organization and vital activity.</p>

<p>In the brief sketch I have now given of this interesting subject,
such obvious and striking facts alone have been adduced as a traveller's
note-book can supply. The argument must therefore lose
much of its weight from the absence of detail and accumulated
examples. There is, however, such a very general accordance in
the phenomena of distribution as separately deduced from the
various classes or kingdoms of the organic world, that whenever
one class of animals or plants exhibits in a clearly marked manner
certain relations between two countries, the other classes will certainly
show similar ones, though it may be in a greater or a less
degree. Birds and insects will teach us the same truths; and even
animals and plants, though existing under such different conditions,
and multiplied and dispersed by such a generally distinct process,
will never give conflicting testimony, however much they
may differ as regards the amount of relationship between distant
regions indicated by them, and consequently notwithstanding the
greater or less weight either may have in the determining of
questions of this nature.</p>

<p>This is my apology for offering to the Linnean Society the present
imperfect outline in anticipation of the more detailed proofs
and illustrations which I hope to bring forward on a future
occasion.

According to Natterer, the dental formula of <i>J. nigra</i> and <i>J. fissipes</i> is
<sup>18-18</sup>/<sub>18-18</sub>, of <i>J. sclerops</i> <sup>19-19</sup>/<sub>20-20</sub>, of <i>J. callifrons</i> and <i>J. punctulata</i> <sup>20-20</sup>/<sub>18-18</sub>.</p></div>

By this term I denote that squarish flat area bounded by the postfrontal
and squamosal bones laterally, by the occiput posteriorly, and by a line joining
the outer angles of the postfrontals anteriorly.</p></div>

In a skull of this species 14<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches long, in the British Museum, the
vomers are completely excluded from the palate, and their anterior ends do not
extend for an eighth of an inch beyond the palatine part of the palato-maxillary
suture, which lies on a level with the anterior margin of the twelfth alveolus.
Each vomer is 2<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches long, and presents the same general form as that of
<i>Jacare</i>; only the anterior division is but a very small, flat and thin plate, not a
quarter of an inch long. The boundary of the median nares is formed in equal
proportions by the vomer and the palatine, and is opposite the fourteenth tooth.
The hinder end of the vomer articulates with the end of the descending process
of the prefrontal.</p></div>

Or it is possible that the <i>Rhynchosuchus</i> from New Guinea, which I have
examined, is specifically distinct from the Bornean form.</p></div>

The second and third cervical rows in <i>Caiman palpebrosus</i> and <i>trigonatus</i>
also contain a median scute, and consequently an odd number of scutes. In
<i>Caiman trigonatus</i>, the third to the ninth supra-caudal rows have each a median
single scute.</p></div>

The suspicion above expressed has been fully confirmed by observations
made by Mr. J. J. Bennett, the Secretary of the Linnean Society. Mr. Bennett
informs me that, in an aquarium in his possession, an <i>Astacus fluviatilis</i> has
twice cast its shell, and the process of moulting was on each occasion accomplished
without any splitting of the shell at the joints of the claws.</p></div>
